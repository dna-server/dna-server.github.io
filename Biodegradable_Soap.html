<title>Biodegradable Soap</title>

<h1 id="pageName">Biodegradable Soap</h1>

<Chemicals-Warning></Chemicals-Warning>

<a href="https://naturecode.org/biodegradable-soap/" target="_blank">Originally shared at https://naturecode.org/biodegradable-soap/</a>

<p>Everything that’s produced in the modern world has some negative effect on the environment, and the same goes for soap from the store. </p>



<p>However, you can make eco-friendly soap right from the confines of your own kitchen or bathroom, without taxing the environment.</p>



<p>You can make <a href="https://naturecode.org/reduce-reuse-recycle/">eco-friendly</a> soap at home with a few different methods. </p>



<p>Just know going into this that it’s going to feel different from that colorful stuff in the bottle, or the processed bar that you keep on the countertop. </p>



<p>It can take some getting used to, but it’s far better for the environment.</p>




<p>You’re going to be using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="something called lye (opens in a new tab)">something called lye</a> for these recipes, which is a chemical compound that can be dangerous if not handled properly.</p>

<hr>

<h3><span id="How_Dangerous_is_Lye_to_Use">How Dangerous is Lye to Use?</span></h3>



<p>It can cause blindness, chemical burns that remove skin, and can be fatal if inhaled. </p>



<p>We can’t stress this enough, <strong>use protective gear when making soap</strong>. Lye is a necessary component in making any soap, and can’t be avoided.</p>



<p>If
you make soap without lye, you’re doing one of two things:</p>



<ul><li>You’re just making a goop that is going to settle and won’t clean your skin properly.</li><li>You’re reusing old, non eco-friendly soap to melt and mix together, which negates most of the reasons behind making eco-friendly soap in the first place.</li></ul>

<hr>

<p>Preparing your space is absolutely critical to not only making great eco-friendly soap, but remaining completely safe throughout the process.</p>



<p>Get everything together in a well-ventilated area. </p>



<p>There is some volatility involved in any soap recipe, so being in the middle of a big space with plenty of open windows (and a few fans) will be your best bet.</p>



<p><strong>You’ll want to put on rubber gloves or any other <a href="https://naturecode.org/disposable-gloves-alternatives/" class="rank-math-link">disposable gloves alternatives</a>, some form of protective eyewear</strong>,<strong> and a face mask to avoid inhaling any fumes that rise from the lye mixture</strong>.<strong> Do not gloss over the importance of this</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="Olive_Oil_Soap">Olive Oil Soap</span></h2>




<p>This feels slick on your skin, but soaks in and will not only clean as well as other soap, but actually hydrate your skin. </p>



<p>You’ll need a few things to get started:</p>



<ul><li>Extra virgin olive oil</li><li>Caustic soda</li><li>Purified water</li><li>Sea salt</li><li>Glass bowl</li><li>A food thermometer</li><li>High sidewall pot</li><li>Handheld blender or whisk</li><li>Something to mould the soap</li><li>Tea Towel</li><li>Surgical spirit</li></ul>



<h3><span id="Step_1">Step 1</span></h3>



<p>Put 11 oz of water into a glass bowl. Take a teaspoon of sea salt and add it into the water. Give it a quick mix.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_2">Step 2</span></h3>



<p>Add caustic soda to the mix, give it a quick mix. A chemical reaction will result in a gas escaping from the top, which is why it’s good to have your mask and protective eyewear on. </p>



<p>The reaction has to settle on its own, so put this to the side until it looks clear in the bowl again.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_3">Step 3</span></h3>



<p>Measure 33 oz of olive oil, then pour it into your high sidewall cooking pot on the stove. When you’re done with this, check the temperature of your caustic soda mixture. </p>



<p>You want to see it drop to just below 135 F. Once it has, use your hand blender or whisk and mix the oil up while slowly pouring the caustic soda mixture into the pot.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_4">Step 4</span></h3>



<p>Mix extremely well. You want to see track marks behind it after the whisk or hand-mixer has gone through it, but don’t mix too much more past that. </p>



<p>You don’t want a thick paste that you can’t even get out of the pot.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_5">Step 5</span></h3>



<p>Pour the mixture into a mould of your choosing. You can use a mini loaf pan if you wish to have smaller bars of soap. Each mould should only be filled about 70% of the way up. </p>



<p>At this point, spray a bit of surgical spirit on top to prevent discoloration. Add the tea towel on top of the pan, and leave to sit for three days.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_6">Step 6</span></h3>



<p>Pop the soap out of the mold and cut them into smaller bars. The tricky part of this is to leave the bars in an aerated space, completely alone for an entire month. </p>



<p>Caustic soda isn’t kind to your skin, but once it absorbs all the oxygen from the air and the liquid from the soap, it will be completely fine to use on your skin.</p>



<p>Caustic soda is also called lye, which can be dangerous to work with. </p>



<p>That’s why we began this article by telling you to open windows and work in a well-ventilated area with plenty of personal protection. </p>



<p>There are other ways to make soap at home, but they require you to have first purchased non eco-friendly bar soap. </p>



<p>That is a method called melt-and-pour soap making, which isn’t necessarily eco-friendly, so we won’t be covering them in this guide. Instead, this next recipe will also be using a form of lye.</p>



<h2><span id="Coconut_Lavender_Soap">Coconut Lavender Soap</span></h2>



<p>Few things entice you more than the scent of coconut and lavender—there’s just something about the way they <a href="https://www.peacefuldumpling.com/coconut-oil-and-lavender-soap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mix together (opens in a new tab)">mix together</a>. </p>



<p>This recipe will likely be your favorite for the clean feeling, and natural fragrance that remains afterwards. You will need:</p>



<ul><li>20 drops of lavender essential oil</li><li>32 oz of normal olive oil</li><li>16 oz of coconut oil</li><li>16 oz of grapeseed oil</li><li>24 oz of water</li><li>9 oz of lye</li><li>Whisk</li><li>Tea towel</li></ul>



<h3><span id="Step_1-2">Step 1</span></h3>



<p>Put your water in a very large bowl, and then add the lye directly into it. Wait until it reaches about 110 F before you begin working with it.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_2-2">Step 2</span></h3>



<p>In a pot, mix all the oils you have together at once. Gently heat and whisk continuously, all while trying to reach the same temperature as the lye mixture. Be careful not to overheat your oils.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_3-2">Step 3</span></h3>



<p>Once all the oils are heated and mixed, blend them into the lye solution (not the other way around, because we don’t want the lye in the hot pot). </p>



<p>Get ready to pour the soap into a mould of your choosing.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_4-2">Step 4</span></h3>



<p>Pour the soap mixture into the mould, and cover it with a tea towel. You’ll want to leave this for three days, just like with our other soap recipe.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_5-2">Step 5</span></h3>



<p>After those three days, cut them into bars of your choosing. Because this is less volatile than our previous recipe, you only need to let them sit, or “cure” for about two weeks prior to use.</p>



<h2><span id="Related_Questions">Related Questions</span></h2>



<h3><span id="Is_Lye_Eco-Friendly_to_Use">Is Lye Eco-Friendly to Use?</span></h3>



<p>The way that lye is made nowadays isn’t natural, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be eco-friendly. </p>



<p>You know that curing method that we talked about? It actually changes the chemical composition of the lye, so it’s no longer harmful when introduced into nature. </p>



<p>That soap is going to last for a while and get washed down the drain, and when it does, you’re adding essential oils, olive oil, and relatively nothing else into the environment. </p>



<p>That’s not only fits with the <a href="https://naturecode.org/biodegradable-definition/" class="rank-math-link">biodegradable definition</a>, but completely eco-friendly.</p>



<p>The production of any chemical is going to have a negative impact on the environment, but in your hands, you can transform it to something truly sustainable. </p>



<p>Lye basically makes the physical composition of soap more solid and sturdy, and will dissolve entirely in your soap.</p>

				<p>
					Trash Magic is a game of MUTUAL AID quests. We want to have strong communities and live well. Many of us are suffering from financial challenges, loss of community, and meaningless lifestyles. Consumer-based economics has generated an unfathomable amount of second-hand materials. By taking this opportunity to design useful things out of free materials, we believe that <i>we can live in a society that costs no money to build and maintain</i>. When good things made for free contain instructions so that other people can copy them for free, we replace a culture of ownership and scarcity with a culture of replication and abundance.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<! -- -->
		<div class="box-container">
			<div class="box">
				Why does every Trash Magic blueprint in our system include these explanations? Reflect on how every cell in a body contains the DNA to replicate that entire body. Any page in this system can be copied and shared. No matter which blueprint you copy or how many, every single one will contain all the necessary instructions for anyone else who stumbles along any single page to not only copy the entire digital network of information, but also to build a free and healthy community in the real world.

					We define Trash Magic in 3 ways.
					<br>
					<br>				
					Trash Magic is: (1) good for the community, (2) made for free, and (3) holds instructions to (a) copy, (b) change, and (c) recycle itself
					<br>
					<br>
					(1) GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY:
					<br>
					If a helpful thing can be created and used by individuals sustainably without exploitation, or if it is accessible, sustainable, and useful for the community at large, then it is good for the community.
					<br>
					<br>
					(2) MADE FOR FREE:
					<br>
					Ideally, the thing is upcycled from used materials. If it is sustainably sourced from nature, this is okay too. It's even normal to spend a little money to get basic tools. But if something is too expensive or rare for most people to get, or too complicated for most people to use, then it will not replicate very easily. We want everything that we create to be easy for others to copy, because we love to share and we want everyone to be happy and healthy and have what we have.
					<br><br>
					We are scaling this system at a "negative marginal cost", which means that the more we make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff (sharing our blueprints openly as we do so), the easier it becomes for everyone else to make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff. We create social networks and communities in which any person helping to build a free society can share their projects with everyone else, so <i>everyone benefits</i> <b>exponentially</b>. For the first time in history, our planet is covered with perfectly good stuff that nobody wants just because it's not "brand new". Everything has already been mined out of the ground, woven, molded, purified, shaped, welded, and otherwise assembled into a useful form. The tools needed to work with these resources are now widespread, as well.
					<br>
					<br>
					(3) HOLDS INSTRUCTIONS:
					<br>
					Everything we make should be easy to use and copy. The copying instructions or a hyperlink to them should be physically connected to the thing itself. The instructions should be easy to find and understand. The blueprints and assembly should be designed in a way that makes the thing easy to modify and adapt to new situations and needs. It should also contain information on how it can be taken apart without destroying it and how the individual parts can be reused in new projects.
					<br><br>
					This continual reuse becomes its Lore. The Story of when and how an artifact has been used becomes part of its value. Mythic Quests are fulfilled through Trash Magic. This Story can be infused with the Instructions for further Magick. Imagine how magical it would be to teach The Instructions of replication through Storytelling.
					<br><br>
					Everything should copy easily because the replication instructions are literally right in your hands. The replication instructions should also hold an overview of the Trash Magic system (just like the one that you're reading now). This allows us to share not only our creations themselves, but the goals of the overarching system of Trash Magic.

			<div class="box">
				You "win" the game when your community has free and open access to a COMPLETE SET, which is a human network that meets all the following physical and social needs:
				<br><br>
				PHYSICAL HUMAN NEEDS
				<br>• Food
				<br>• Clean water
				<br>• Disposal of human waste
				<br>• Tools
				<br>• Buildings with Temperature Control: the air of indoor environments should have heat and cooling of some kind, these shelters should be constructed in such a way that this needs minimal...
				<br>• Energy (use natural heat and coolness from the environment)
				<br>• Communication / networking / controls / automation / audio / video / simulations: these are the real reasons we need “computers”
				<br>• Medicine and drugs
				<br><br>
				SOCIAL HUMAN NEEDS
				<br>• Generalized and Specific Social Supports
				<br>• Accessibility to participate in and opportunities to contribute to society
				<br>• Therapy and Counseling
				<br>• Social and communal places, 3rd places, walkable communities, etc.
				<br>• Access to Trash Magic Networks, which of course should include all of this
				<br><br>
				All of these needs count as their own SET. For example, the FOOD SET is a collection of techniques for cultivating, finding, or preparing foods. When you begin building communities and infrastructure in the real world, it might start small. But as you grow, you will soon have more and more items in each SET. Eventually you will be able to provide for these needs without financial challenges, lack of community, or meaningless lifestyles. When all of your SETS are filled with techniques that meet human needs in free, communal, and meaningful ways, you have a COMPLETE SET. Congratulations! Now it's time to RECYCLE and REPLICATE.
				<br><br>
				Replication Quests plant the seeds of the entire Trash Magic system. Replication Quests are about giving things away for free. You don't need to have a COMPLETE SET to do this. You just have to give something away for free. When the thing has copying instructions attached, anyone who receives it can recreate that particular thing or the entire Trash Magic system. You can also take things apart and spread the separate pieces, making sure that each individual piece contains all the copying instructions. To do this, first make a thing. Then RECYCLE it by detaching it into separate parts and pass them along to different people who you hope will REPLICATE the whole thing for free.
				<br><br>
				If, for example, the item is made from five parts, then each person who gets one of the five parts can use the copying instructions attached to rebuild the other four parts for free to make their own copy of that item. Another way to do this is to have a team of five people. They assemble to complete a task, then all five go out to find four new members for five new teams. Both of these examples show how to replicate one thing into five. Hyperseeds are any parts of any COMPLETE SET that can evolve itself into a healthy community in the real world by using free parts from its surroundings.

					You can start wherever you feel most excited or comfortable. Here are three starter quests which are often recommended. Feel free to skip around as needed:
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your first quest is to replicate the Trash Magic Trilogy, read the Trash Magic Manifesto, and upload these books to archive.org and github.com, as well as any other online or offline databases or hosting pages you use. Please use tags like TRASH MAGIC, SELF-REPLICATION, GEOMETRY, UPCYCLING, and COMMUNITY when you do so. Save a copy on a usb drive. Email a copy to yourself and your friends. You can download these books by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the page or this link: <a href="https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a>. 
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your second quest is to create your own set of online documents just like this one, which can be accessed by anyone online at https://[your_username].github.io. You can download-replicate any blueprint from this system by right-clicking on the page, then selecting 'SAVE PAGE AS' (you can do this on any website). You can download-replicate the entire system with the button at the bottom of the page (it's currently less than 60 MB). Upload your set of blueprints to your github profile under a repository called [your_username] (name your homepage index.html). Upload a copy to archive.org, etc. Print a copy for offline reference: <a href="print_friendly_footer.html">HERE</a> is a link to the minified version of these explanations for easier printing.
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your third quest is to make physical hyperlinks, called hyperseeds. Replicate them by writing your github.io url on cardboard shapes or other free materials, along with the words TRASH MAGIC, and a QR code which points to the url. Include colorful geometric drawings such as a golden pentagram or a unicursal hexagram. Then give these to others or leave them to be found. Make them beautiful. All Trash Magic is art!
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your next quests are entirely up to you!

				Trash means free materials and Magic means the desire to replicate using instructions. RNA Polymerase does something like Trash Magic. The Magician and their desire to replicate a set are always two of the elements of the set itself. What we are doing inspires <i>desire</i> in us, the desire to participate in the great wonder of Life and Self-Replication. We also desire to live well and be happy and see our community members doing the same. Trash Magic is meant to be inherent in everything that we create. Trash Magic is both Art and Technology that moves us in a wave of awe to Replicate and Recycle. Thus, the name "Trash Magic" refers to the excitement and wonder of playing the game and participating in Life Itself.
