<html><body>WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC? == Trash Magic is a game of MUTUAL AID quests. We want to have strong communities and live well. Many of us are suffering from financial challenges, loss of community, and meaningless lifestyles. Consumer-based economics has generated an unfathomable amount of second-hand materials. By taking this opportunity to design useful things out of free materials, we believe that <i>we can live in a society that costs no money to build and maintain</i>. When good things made for free contain instructions so that other people can copy them for free, we replace a culture of ownership and scarcity with a culture of replication and abundance. == Why does every Trash Magic blueprint in our system include these explanations? For the same reason that every cell in a body contains the DNA to replicate that entire body. Any page in this system can be copied and shared. And no matter which blueprint you copy or how many, every single one will contain all the necessary instructions for anyone else who stumbles along any single page to not only copy the entire digital network of information, but also to build a free and healthy community in the real world. == This system currently lives at https://dna-server.github.io == We define Trash Magic in 3 ways. == Trash Magic is: (1) good for the community, (2) made for free, and (3) holds instructions to (a) copy, (b) change, and (c) recycle itself == (1) GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY: == If a helpful thing can be created and used sustainably without exploitation, or if it is accessible, sustainable, and useful for the community at large, then it is good for the community. == (2) MADE FOR FREE: == Ideally, the thing is upcycled from used materials. If it is sustainably sourced from nature, this is okay too. It's even normal to spend a little money to get basic tools. But if something is too expensive or rare for most people to get, or too complicated for most people to use, then it will not replicate very easily. We want everything that we create to be easy for others to copy, because we love to share and we want everyone to be happy and healthy and have what we have. == We are scaling this system at a "negative marginal cost", which means that the more we make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff (sharing our blueprints openly as we do so), the easier it becomes for everyone else to make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff. We create social networks and communities in which any person helping to build a free society can share their projects with everyone else, so everyone benefits. For the first time in history, our planet is covered with perfectly good stuff that nobody wants just because it's not "brand new". Everything has already been mined out of the ground, woven, molded, purified, shaped, welded, and otherwise assembled into a useful form. The tools needed to work with these resources are now widespread, as well. == (3) HOLDS INSTRUCTIONS: == Everything we make should be easy to use and copy. The copying instructions or a hyperlink to them should be physically connected to the thing itself. The instructions should be easy to find and understand. The blueprints and assembly should be designed in a way that makes the thing easy to modify and adapt to new situations and needs. It should also contain information on how it can be taken apart without destroying it and how the individual parts can be reused in new projects. Everything should copy easily because the replication instructions are literally right in your hands. The replication instructions should also hold an overview of the Trash Magic system (just like the one that you're reading now). This allows us to share not only our creations themselves, but the goals of the overarching system of Trash Magic. == You "win" the game when your community has free and open access to a COMPLETE SET, which is a human network that meets all the following physical and social needs: == PHYSICAL HUMAN NEEDS• Food• Clean water• Disposal of human waste• Tools• Temperature control inside sheltered areas: the air of indoor environments should have heat and cooling of some kind, these shelters should be constructed in such a way that this needs minimal...• Energy (use natural heat and coolness from the environment)• Communication / networking / controls / automation / audio / video / simulations: these are the real reasons we need “computers”• Medicine and drugs == SOCIAL HUMAN NEEDS• Generalized and Specific Social Supports• Accessibility to participate in and opportunities to contribute to society• Therapy and Counseling• Social and communal places, both physical and online (3rd places, etc.)• Access to Trash Magic Networks, which of course should include all of this == All of these needs count as their own SET. For example, the FOOD SET is a collection of techniques for cultivating, finding, or preparing foods. == When you begin building communities and infrastructure in the real world, it might start small. But as you grow, you will soon have more and more items in each SET. Eventually you will be able to provide for these needs without financial challenges, lack of community, or meaningless lifestyles. When all of your SETS are filled with techniques that meet human needs in free, communal, and meaningful ways, you have a COMPLETE SET. That means it's time to RECYCLE and REPLICATE. == Replication Quests plant the seeds of the entire Trash Magic system. Replication Quests are about giving things away for free. When the thing has copying instructions attached, anyone who receives it can recreate that particular thing or the entire Trash Magic system. You can also take things apart and spread the separate pieces, making sure that each individual piece contains all the copying instructions. To do this, first make a thing. Then RECYCLE it by detaching it into separate parts and pass them along to different people who you hope will REPLICATE the whole thing for free. == If, for example, the item is made from five parts, then each person who gets one of the five parts can use the copying instructions attached to rebuild the other four parts for free to make their own copy of that item. Another way to do this is to have a team of five people. They assemble to complete a task, then all five go out to find four new members for five new teams. Both of these examples show how to replicate one thing into five. Hyperseeds are any parts of any COMPLETE SET that can evolve itself into a healthy community in the real world by using free parts from its surroundings. == You can start wherever you feel most excited or comfortable. Here are three starter quests which are often recommended. Feel free to skip around as needed: == Your first quest is to replicate the Trash Magic Trilogy, read the Trash Magic Manifesto, and upload these books to archive.org and github.com, as well as any other online or offline databases or hosting pages you use. Please use tags like TRASH MAGIC, SELF-REPLICATION, GEOMETRY, UPCYCLING, and COMMUNITY when you do so. Save a copy on a usb drive. Email a copy to yourself and your friends. You can download these books by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the page or this link: https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip == Your second quest is to create your own set of online documents just like this one, which can be accessed by anyone online at https://[your_username].github.io. You can download-replicate any blueprint(s) from this system or the entire system with the buttons at the bottom of the page. Then, upload your set of blueprints to your github profile under a repository called [your_username] (name your homepage index.html). Upload a copy to archive.org, etc. Print a copy for offline reference. == Your third quest is to make physical hyperlinks, called hyperseeds. Replicate them by writing your github.io url on cardboard shapes or other free materials, along with the words TRASH MAGIC, and a QR code which points to the url. Include colorful geometric drawings such as a golden pentagram or a unicursal hexagram. Then give these to others or leave them to be found. Make them beautiful. All Trash Magic is art! == Your next quests are entirely up to you!  == REMEMBER == Everything Replicates: make tons of copies of your favorite stuff == Everything Evolves: change each copy individually as needed == Everything Dies: recycle unnecessary or broken copies == REPEAT
