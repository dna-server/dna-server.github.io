<h1>Trash Magic: Political Philosophy</h1>

This philosophy is contained in my book, the <a href="https://lafelabs.github.io/Trash_Magic_Manifesto.pdf">Trash Magic Manifesto and Action Coloring Book</a>, which is both a free e-book in pdf format and a hardcopy paperback sold at cost <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/lafe-spietz/trash-magic-manifesto-and-action-coloring-book-revision-1/paperback/product-22790530.html">here</a>.

<p>
My arguments in that work can be summarized with a set of over-arching ideas. I will attempt so summarize those here.

</p><p>
</p><h3>Numbers are the Problem</h3>

When I looked deeply into what I felt was wrong with our industrial 
system it all pointed to one major problem: the primacy of numbers over 
other types of ideas. The supposedly competing 
industrial/political/economic systems like "capitalism" and "communism" 
all agree that some type of numerical description of value is 
appropriate, be it hours of labor, ounces of gold, or dollars of bank 
debt.  Ultimately once you believe that a number can describe value you 
get a very similar system to the other people who made that choice.  
<p>
I argue that this is a choice we made as a species which was not 
necessary and can be un-made. I also argue that it is a deeply evil 
choice which is always based on either destructive extractionist 
industry (dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it) or human misery(the 
wage labor system, which is clearly based on extracting misery from 
others).  
</p><p>
I claim that the beliefs of what are called "capitalism" or "economics" 
constitute a religion which involves a blind faith in the reality of 
numbers that is not supported by the observable ways of Nature. 

</p><h3>Free Technology </h3>

The whole point of this thesis work is to create a set of guidelines for
 creating technology that leads to a better world.  To that end, I 
describe a set of design rules for truly free technology using a much 
stricter definition of "free" than the so-called "free software" people 
from the "tech" industry.  I put both of these in scare quotes because 
there is nothing free about technology that is so hard to use that no 
one can use it without relying on a technocrat priest class who answers 
to no one (the so-called "hackers" with their awful broken software and 
their useless 3d printers.)  

<p>

The goal of free technology is to always create a "technological 
complete set", which is a concept I introduce here that is a set of 
interacting technologies which can be sustainably managed by as small a 
group of people as possible to provide all basic human needs in an 
advanced civilization including: food, medicine, clean water, waste 
processing, industrial fabrication, communication, transportation of 
people and goods, 

</p><p>

As I mention above, part of what makes technology free is that it can be
 used by, modified by, and controlled by all users, not just a priest class. 
 This means that the process of teaching people, especially children, all 
the underlying principles and practices to make, fix, and run that 
technology have to be an integral part of the technology itself.

</p><h3>Trash Magic</h3>

I reject the whole culture of the technocratic priesthood who currently 
control technology.  As part of that process I reach back and take the 
ideas from outside of that which are called "magic", or "alchemy", etc. 
as better ways to describe the kind of technology I want to construct.  
This is in part a conscious choice to annoy members of the technocrat 
classes who worship modern science as a religion and get very agitated 
when presented with ideas that might be called "magic".  

<p>

Trash refers to how all technology should be: rather than based on 
hoarding the products of mining, the feedstock for everything should be 
what is currently known as "trash".  Part of what makes technology truly
 free is that not only does the input feedstock not cost money or need 
mining, but there is a stream of fresh material that is always available
 which can be used for future expansion. This is, for now, clearly true 
of what we call trash.  Modern industrial civilization creates trash at 
an insane pace, which has an incredible bounty of valuable material.  
Even just the trash from the cell phone disaster is vast, consisting of 
billions of built-to-fail phones which have a staggering array of useful
 materials, chemicals and devices.  Capitalism literally sows the seeds 
of its own destruction, and it's time to plant, cultivate, and harvest 
those seeds.  

</p><p>

</p><h3>Post-Numerical Values</h3>

I argue that to get rid of numbers as the basis for value we must move 
to more of a story-based value system.  By that I mean the physical 
things in society should be defined by their stories, which are divided 
roughly into two groups, which I call "tales" and "lore".  The tales are
 the specific stories of how a particular object came to be: who made it
 and why, what they did, who they passed it on to, what they did with it
 and how and why.  All things that have been used tell a story, and we 
as humans value stories very highly and in a way that is outside of 
numerical value and cannot be put in a spreadsheet.  

<p>

"Lore" is the cultural value of a thing that is embodied in the methods 
for reproducing that thing, which all things should have.  This is a 
combination of specific knowhow on building the thing itself which is 
physically integrated into the thing and pointers to other information 
which are useful for creating the rest of the technological complete set
 of which that thing is an element. Both tales and lore are to be 
encoded into physical things using the language tools of Roctal, 
Geometron, and Action Geometry, as I describe elsewhere on this 
site(that's the primary reason I'm developing those systems).

</p><p>

</p><h3>Return to the Oceans</h3>

I argue that for all their dangers, the oceans are where humanity should
 migrate.  There is so much energy and nutrients out there, and private 
property does not encumber them as much in our current system, it only 
makes sense to move in that direction.  Scalable permaculture at sea has
 already been shown to work. The current industrial system is on a path 
to flood most of its major cities already with ocean water.  This should
 not be seen as a disaster but as an opportunity to start over, to bring
 nutrients and energy to all people in those places and eliminate the 
private property system which is currently the main source of structural
 violence in cities.  Given enough time, the gangsters who currently 
rule society will find a way to apply private property to the flooded 
cities, and we must not let them get that time, and immediately build 
vast industrial systems outside their control before the floods happen, 
so that by the time the cities are fully flooded it's too late and the 
propertarians have lost all control over humanity. 


<h3>What is the opposite of terrorism?</h3>

If terrorism is using violence to enforce ones world view on others, the
 opposite of that is giving away free life-giving technology to anyone 
who wants it (but no one who doesn't want it) regardless of their world 
view or religion or politics.  And that is our goal here.  It is also, 
ultimately the best way to fight terrorism.  To move beyond  old cycles 
we must base a movement entirely on building new, free stuff, and 
making that stuff so much better technically than the existing stuff that
everyone chooses to move on simply because the new stuff works better.

<h1>
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?
</h1>
</div>


<div class="blue border">
<p>If we know how to make something useful and cool from free parts that are easy to get, we can make as many as we want, all for free.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>If those items somehow hold their own blueprints or copying instructions, then the items become "self-replicating", like DNA.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>They are built for free and given away for free. When a community of people publish all their free blueprints for building free stuff on a free website, then the entire library of blueprints is available anytime to anyone in that community or on that network.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
Here's how to make your own free website:
<br>- - - - -<br>Make a GitHub.com account (your username will be your website name), and upload your own blueprints to share with others. You can copy this website to use as a template by clicking the download buttons at the bottom.
<br>- - - - -<br>Upload to a GitHub repository with the same name as your username. Your site will live at (YOUR_USERNAME).github.io and index.html will always be your homepage.
<br>- - - - -<br>Show your friends so they can make their own. Add links to each others' websites.
</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Recycling and free-sharing have always been part of being human. But we are in a special period. For the first time in history, all the chemicals, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well (as well as the tools needed in order to work with them) are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>The biggest change of all, however, is digital networks. We now have a great density of intercommunication and material transport (plus overflowing waste streams and pollution as a result). But being online doesn't have to cost money. Three people with any sort of wifi circuit or LoRa chip can make their own network for free. So can three hundred, three thousand, or three million.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>Our new internet ought to be a digital archive of all the things that matter to us IN THE REAL WORLD. The new internet becomes like an augmented-reality-game-map, showing users all the places around town they can meet cool people or get free stuff. The free stuff has a label that links to its website on the library-map showing how it replicates itself for free. The new internet should simply be a digital library/map of the free community, having dedicated pages for all important physical things like rivers, dumpsters, and farms. The purpose of the library/map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Trading USB drives with each other is a kind of internet. Share memes. Design social circuits. Create physical social media. Instead of a post online, trying sharing a cool or useful thing with a real person irl. Even better if that thing contains its own instructions for making more of itself for free!</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>All of this can be done while still living with capitalism and obeying the law, making it a good option for everyone to participate in. Additionally, every time anyone adds a single blueprint to their personal library, it makes it easier for everyone else in the network to live for free. All of the items and places point back to the online pages where their blueprints are shared. This is the same network on which all the rest of our blueprints are shared, just like DNA in any cell contains the blueprints to recreate all the rest of your body.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>If anything has been built thrice for profit, then it's obviously possible to build for free. If somehow the people who had the necessary materials spoke with the people who were already experienced in assembling, growing, or producing it, they could find a way for free materials in their surrounding environment to be crafted into that free thing. If they can repeat this process consistently, they have designed a <i>social circuit</i>. It is the social circuits which connect us and make up our new free world, not just the online networks. We want everything to be free for everyone, everywhere, immediately. The free world will recycle the capitalist world the way that fungus recycles a log.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>Don't assume it would be impossible to build things just because there's no money circulating. If the people who provided the materials and the people who built it catch the vision of Trash Magic, then it can be built for free consistently. Everyone in the Trash Magic network is incentivized to do and give what they can for free because they themselves are benefitting so much from others' free gifts to them.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Due to habits of pollution and consumerism, we live in a very unusual age. For the first time in history, all the elements, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere. The consequences of this have been horrific, but we must find a way to recycle all of this waste. We can make good use of basically everything that we usually just throw away. So much has already been thrown away that everything is already everywhere. The tools to work with these materials are also thrown away everywhere. We are free to be creative here. Almost all unwanted stuff could work very well if it was repurposed into something new. Experiments always take time, go easy on yourself!</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>The new internet should simply be a digital map of the local free community, having dedicated pages for every important physical thing like medicine, waste reuse streams, and food providers. The purpose of the map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY. All of this can be done while still living with capitalism. It is intended to be done as close to free as possible and the whole system scales at a negative marginal cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
<b>this means everytime anyone posts anything on the Trash Magic network, it increases the strength and density of the whole network, making it easier for everyone else to connect however they like to the network.</b>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
<b>
<i>
it gets easer for everyone anytime anyone shares ANY Trash Magic, because participation in the network to any degree strengthens the momentum of the whole network. soon an inevitable thermodynamic shift occurs, pouring energy into the Trash Magic network in a movement that will make the most agile blitz-scaling of the venture capitalists look hesitant and ponderous.
