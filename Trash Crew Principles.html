! self-replicating trash crew
<br>	<b>- action values</b>
<br>		- don't be hasty
<br>	<b>- social values</b>
<br>		- everyone having strengths and weaknesses; humble yourself; support each other
<br>		- everyone has good days and bad days
<br>		- make decisions unanimously
<br>		- mutual benefit
<br>	<b>- recommending Trash Magic to people</b>
<br>		- cut out the unnecessary stuff, stick to the facts and keep the facts as few and as obvious as possible
<br>		-	- have a rock-solid explanation of what you want and why, keep the community health as the sole focus
<br>		- it not our job to get into arguments or debates
<br>			<i>- our only job is to spread the word,</i>
<br>				- everyone who understands it will recognize its usefulness
<br>				- the curious will ask questions even if they don't accept it
<br>					- answer with simple and clear explanations which always return to the focus on community health
<br>				- those who just want to argue or mock you can safely be ignored
<br>			<i>- if someone is clearly just trying to get into a debate or prove you wrong:</i>
<br>				- turn your comments instead to anyone else in the room who may be sincerely interested in what you have to say
<br>				- if no one in the room is sincerely interested, it's better to save your time and energy about this subject for other people
