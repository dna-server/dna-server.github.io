<h1 id="pageName">Biodegradable Soap</h1>

<Chemicals-Warning></Chemicals-Warning>

<a href="https://naturecode.org/biodegradable-soap/" target="_blank">Originally shared at https://naturecode.org/biodegradable-soap/</a>

<p>Everything that’s produced in the modern world has some negative effect on the environment, and the same goes for soap from the store. </p>



<p>However, you can make eco-friendly soap right from the confines of your own kitchen or bathroom, without taxing the environment.</p>



<p>You can make <a href="https://naturecode.org/reduce-reuse-recycle/">eco-friendly</a> soap at home with a few different methods. </p>



<p>Just know going into this that it’s going to feel different from that colorful stuff in the bottle, or the processed bar that you keep on the countertop. </p>



<p>It can take some getting used to, but it’s far better for the environment.</p>




<p>You’re going to be using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="something called lye (opens in a new tab)">something called lye</a> for these recipes, which is a chemical compound that can be dangerous if not handled properly.</p>

<hr>

<h3><span id="How_Dangerous_is_Lye_to_Use">How Dangerous is Lye to Use?</span></h3>



<p>It can cause blindness, chemical burns that remove skin, and can be fatal if inhaled. </p>



<p>We can’t stress this enough, <strong>use protective gear when making soap</strong>. Lye is a necessary component in making any soap, and can’t be avoided.</p>



<p>If
you make soap without lye, you’re doing one of two things:</p>



<ul><li>You’re just making a goop that is going to settle and won’t clean your skin properly.</li><li>You’re reusing old, non eco-friendly soap to melt and mix together, which negates most of the reasons behind making eco-friendly soap in the first place.</li></ul>

<hr>

<p>Preparing your space is absolutely critical to not only making great eco-friendly soap, but remaining completely safe throughout the process.</p>



<p>Get everything together in a well-ventilated area. </p>



<p>There is some volatility involved in any soap recipe, so being in the middle of a big space with plenty of open windows (and a few fans) will be your best bet.</p>



<p><strong>You’ll want to put on rubber gloves or any other <a href="https://naturecode.org/disposable-gloves-alternatives/" class="rank-math-link">disposable gloves alternatives</a>, some form of protective eyewear</strong>,<strong> and a face mask to avoid inhaling any fumes that rise from the lye mixture</strong>.<strong> Do not gloss over the importance of this</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="Olive_Oil_Soap">Olive Oil Soap</span></h2>




<p>This feels slick on your skin, but soaks in and will not only clean as well as other soap, but actually hydrate your skin. </p>



<p>You’ll need a few things to get started:</p>



<ul><li>Extra virgin olive oil</li><li>Caustic soda</li><li>Purified water</li><li>Sea salt</li><li>Glass bowl</li><li>A food thermometer</li><li>High sidewall pot</li><li>Handheld blender or whisk</li><li>Something to mould the soap</li><li>Tea Towel</li><li>Surgical spirit</li></ul>



<h3><span id="Step_1">Step 1</span></h3>



<p>Put 11 oz of water into a glass bowl. Take a teaspoon of sea salt and add it into the water. Give it a quick mix.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_2">Step 2</span></h3>



<p>Add caustic soda to the mix, give it a quick mix. A chemical reaction will result in a gas escaping from the top, which is why it’s good to have your mask and protective eyewear on. </p>



<p>The reaction has to settle on its own, so put this to the side until it looks clear in the bowl again.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_3">Step 3</span></h3>



<p>Measure 33 oz of olive oil, then pour it into your high sidewall cooking pot on the stove. When you’re done with this, check the temperature of your caustic soda mixture. </p>



<p>You want to see it drop to just below 135 F. Once it has, use your hand blender or whisk and mix the oil up while slowly pouring the caustic soda mixture into the pot.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_4">Step 4</span></h3>



<p>Mix extremely well. You want to see track marks behind it after the whisk or hand-mixer has gone through it, but don’t mix too much more past that. </p>



<p>You don’t want a thick paste that you can’t even get out of the pot.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_5">Step 5</span></h3>



<p>Pour the mixture into a mould of your choosing. You can use a mini loaf pan if you wish to have smaller bars of soap. Each mould should only be filled about 70% of the way up. </p>



<p>At this point, spray a bit of surgical spirit on top to prevent discoloration. Add the tea towel on top of the pan, and leave to sit for three days.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_6">Step 6</span></h3>



<p>Pop the soap out of the mold and cut them into smaller bars. The tricky part of this is to leave the bars in an aerated space, completely alone for an entire month. </p>



<p>Caustic soda isn’t kind to your skin, but once it absorbs all the oxygen from the air and the liquid from the soap, it will be completely fine to use on your skin.</p>



<p>Caustic soda is also called lye, which can be dangerous to work with. </p>



<p>That’s why we began this article by telling you to open windows and work in a well-ventilated area with plenty of personal protection. </p>



<p>There are other ways to make soap at home, but they require you to have first purchased non eco-friendly bar soap. </p>



<p>That is a method called melt-and-pour soap making, which isn’t necessarily eco-friendly, so we won’t be covering them in this guide. Instead, this next recipe will also be using a form of lye.</p>



<h2><span id="Coconut_Lavender_Soap">Coconut Lavender Soap</span></h2>



<p>Few things entice you more than the scent of coconut and lavender—there’s just something about the way they <a href="https://www.peacefuldumpling.com/coconut-oil-and-lavender-soap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mix together (opens in a new tab)">mix together</a>. </p>



<p>This recipe will likely be your favorite for the clean feeling, and natural fragrance that remains afterwards. You will need:</p>



<ul><li>20 drops of lavender essential oil</li><li>32 oz of normal olive oil</li><li>16 oz of coconut oil</li><li>16 oz of grapeseed oil</li><li>24 oz of water</li><li>9 oz of lye</li><li>Whisk</li><li>Tea towel</li></ul>



<h3><span id="Step_1-2">Step 1</span></h3>



<p>Put your water in a very large bowl, and then add the lye directly into it. Wait until it reaches about 110 F before you begin working with it.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_2-2">Step 2</span></h3>



<p>In a pot, mix all the oils you have together at once. Gently heat and whisk continuously, all while trying to reach the same temperature as the lye mixture. Be careful not to overheat your oils.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_3-2">Step 3</span></h3>



<p>Once all the oils are heated and mixed, blend them into the lye solution (not the other way around, because we don’t want the lye in the hot pot). </p>



<p>Get ready to pour the soap into a mould of your choosing.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_4-2">Step 4</span></h3>



<p>Pour the soap mixture into the mould, and cover it with a tea towel. You’ll want to leave this for three days, just like with our other soap recipe.</p>



<h3><span id="Step_5-2">Step 5</span></h3>



<p>After those three days, cut them into bars of your choosing. Because this is less volatile than our previous recipe, you only need to let them sit, or “cure” for about two weeks prior to use.</p>



<h2><span id="Related_Questions">Related Questions</span></h2>



<h3><span id="Is_Lye_Eco-Friendly_to_Use">Is Lye Eco-Friendly to Use?</span></h3>



<p>The way that lye is made nowadays isn’t natural, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be eco-friendly. </p>



<p>You know that curing method that we talked about? It actually changes the chemical composition of the lye, so it’s no longer harmful when introduced into nature. </p>



<p>That soap is going to last for a while and get washed down the drain, and when it does, you’re adding essential oils, olive oil, and relatively nothing else into the environment. </p>



<p>That’s not only fits with the <a href="https://naturecode.org/biodegradable-definition/" class="rank-math-link">biodegradable definition</a>, but completely eco-friendly.</p>



<p>The production of any chemical is going to have a negative impact on the environment, but in your hands, you can transform it to something truly sustainable. </p>



<p>Lye basically makes the physical composition of soap more solid and sturdy, and will dissolve entirely in your soap.</p>

WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?
</h1>
</div>


<div class="blue border">
<p>If we know how to make something useful and cool from free parts that are easy to get, we can make as many as we want, all for free.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>If those items somehow hold their own blueprints or copying instructions, then the items become "self-replicating", like DNA.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>They are built for free and given away for free. When a community of people publish all their free blueprints for building free stuff on a free website, then the entire library of blueprints is available anytime to anyone in that community or on that network.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>Recycling and free-sharing have always been part of being human. But we are in a special period. For the first time in history, all the chemicals, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well (as well as the tools needed in order to work with them) are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>The biggest change of all, however, is digital networks. We now have a great density of intercommunication and material transport (plus overflowing waste streams and pollution as a result). But being online doesn't have to cost money. Three people with any sort of wifi circuit or LoRa chip can make their own network for free. So can three hundred, three thousand, or three million.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>Our new internet ought to be a digital archive of all the things that matter to us IN THE REAL WORLD. The new internet becomes like an augmented-reality-game-map, showing users all the places around town they can meet cool people or get free stuff. The free stuff has a label that links to its website on the library-map showing how it replicates itself for free. The new internet should simply be a digital library/map of the free community, having dedicated pages for all important physical things like rivers, dumpsters, and farms. The purpose of the library/map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>Trading USB drives with each other is a kind of internet. Share memes. Design social circuits. Create physical social media. Instead of a post online, trying sharing a cool or useful thing with a real person irl. Even better if that thing contains its own instructions for making more of itself for free!</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>All of this can be done while still living with capitalism and obeying the law, making it a good option for everyone to participate in. Additionally, every time anyone adds a single blueprint to their personal library, it makes it easier for everyone else in the network to live for free. All of the items and places point back to the online pages where their blueprints are shared. This is the same network on which all the rest of our blueprints are shared, just like DNA in any cell contains the blueprints to recreate all the rest of your body.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>If anything has been built thrice for profit, then it's obviously possible to build for free. If somehow the people who had the necessary materials spoke with the people who were already experienced in assembling, growing, or producing it, they could find a way for free materials in their surrounding environment to be crafted into that free thing. If they can repeat this process consistently, they have designed a <i>social circuit</i>. It is the social circuits which connect us and make up our new free world, not just the online networks. We want everything to be free for everyone, everywhere, immediately. The free world will recycle the capitalist world the way that fungus recycles a log.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>Don't assume it would be impossible to build things just because there's no money circulating. If the people who provided the materials and the people who built it catch the vision of Trash Magic, then it can be built for free consistently. Everyone in the Trash Magic network is incentivized to do and give what they can for free because they themselves are benefitting so much from others' free gifts to them.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Due to habits of pollution and consumerism, we live in a very unusual age. For the first time in history, all the elements, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere. The consequences of this have been horrific, but we must find a way to recycle all of this waste. We can make good use of basically everything that we usually just throw away. So much has already been thrown away that everything is already everywhere. The tools to work with these materials are also thrown away everywhere. We are free to be creative here. Almost all unwanted stuff could work very well if it was repurposed into something new. Experiments always take time, go easy on yourself!</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>The new internet should simply be a digital map of the local free community, having dedicated pages for every important physical thing like medicine, waste reuse streams, and food providers. The purpose of the map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY. All of this can be done while still living under capitalism. It is intended to be done as close to free as possible and the whole system scales at a negative marginal cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
<b>this means everytime anyone posts anything on the Trash Magic network, it increases the strength and density of the whole network, making it easier for everyone else to connect however they like to the network.</b>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
<b>
<i>
it gets easer for everyone anytime anyone shares ANY Trash Magic, because participation in the network to any degree strengthens the momentum of the whole network. soon an inevitable thermodynamic shift occurs, pouring energy into the Trash Magic network in a movement that will make the most agile blitz-scaling of the venture capitalists look hesitant and ponderous.
