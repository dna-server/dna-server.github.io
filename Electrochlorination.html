"Electrochlorination is the process of producing hypochlorite by passing electric current through salt water. This disinfects the water and makes it safe for human use, such as for drinking water or swimming pools."

From <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-12-Volt-Chlorine-Producing-Unit-for-Water-Puri/" target="_blank">Instructables - DIY 12 volt chlorine producing unit</a>:
<br>
<br>
"... Basically what happens is when you bridge the electrodes with a salt water solution and apply an electrical charge to them you start a chemical reaction called electrolysis. In this particular process the water bubbles and produces a caustic chlorine solution roughly half as strong as laundry bleach.
<br>
<br>
	Per the SWIM for Him website the directions for use are:
	<ol>
		<li>Mix salt &amp; water solution ( approx. Â¼ cup salt to 16 oz water)</li>
		<li>Connect wires to 12 volt source (negative, or black, to negative; positive, or red, to positive)</li>
		<li>Pour the saltwater solution through the CPU into another bottle (observe the bubbling process)</li>
		<li>Carefully repeat the pour-through process 5 times.
			<ol><li>This is different from a chlorate cell as that the water free flows through the unit which does not allow chlorates or perchlorates to form. This process operates at a different voltage and a much lower temperature.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Unhook the battery wires.</li>
		<li>Rinse the CPU by pouring clean water through it.</li>
		<li>Add 10 drops of the solution for each gallon of drinking water.</li>
		<li>Wait one hour before drinking.</li>
</ol>
<br>
	You should also get a clean water test kit (try: <a href="https://www.safewise.com/best-water-testing-kits/">https://www.safewise.com/best-water-testing-kits/</a>). This is for testing electrochlorination and is also just good to have on hand.

<b>
USE ONLY WATER THAT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DISINFECTED FOR DRINKING, COOKING, MAKING ANY PREPARED DRINK, OR FOR BRUSHING TEETH
</b>
<br><br>

    Use <b>bottled</b> water that has not been exposed to flood waters if it is available.<br>
    If you don't have bottled water, <b>boil water</b> to make it safe. Boiling water will kill most types of disease-causing organisms that may be present. If the water is cloudy, filter it through clean clothes or allow it to settle, and draw off the clear water for boiling. <b>Heat the water to a <i>Rolling Boil</i> for one minute</b>, let it cool and store it in clean containers with lids.<br>
    If you can't boil water, you can <b>disinfect it with household bleach</b>. Bleach will kill some, but not all, types of disease-causing organisms that may be in the water. If the water is cloudy, filter it through clean clothes or allow it to settle, and draw off the clear water for disinfection. <b>Add 1/8 teaspoon (or 8 drops) of regular, unscented, liquid household bleach for each gallon of water</b>, stir it well and let it stand for 30 minutes before you use it. Store disinfected water in clean containers with lids.<br>
    If you have a well that has been flooded, the water should be tested and disinfected after flood waters recede. If you suspect your well may be contaminated, contact your local or state health department or agriculture extension agent for specific advice.
