<p style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:0px; text-align:center;"><b>raised garden bed hugelkultur after twenty years</b></p>

</div>

<p>It's a german word and some people can say it all german-ish.  I'm an
 american doofus, so I say "hoogle culture".
I had to spend some time with google to find the right spelling.  Hugal,
 hoogal, huegal, hugel ....   And I really like saying it out loud:  
"hugelkultur, hoogle culture, hoogal kulture ...."  - it could be a 
chant or something.  
</p>

<p>I learned this high-falootin word at 
my <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums">permaculture</a> training.  I also saw it demonstrated on the 
Sepp Holzer terraces and raised beds video - he didn't call it hugelkultur, but he was doing it.</p>

<p>Hugelkultur is nothing more than making raised garden beds filled 
with rotten wood.  This makes for raised garden beds loaded with
<a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/18.0" target="_blank">organic</a> material, nutrients, air pockets for the <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3498_0/permaculture/roots-tap-and-otherwise" target="_blank">roots</a> of what you plant, etc.  As the years pass, the deep <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/5056_0/permaculture/building-soil-faster-than-nature" target="_blank">soil</a>
 of your raised garden bed becomes incredibly rich and loaded with soil 
life.  As the wood shrinks, it makes more tiny air pockets - so your 
hugelkultur becomes sort of self tilling.  The first few years, the <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2592_0/organic-sustainable-practices/composting" target="_blank">composting</a> process will slightly warm your soil giving you a slightly <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2761_0/permaculture/season-extenders" target="_blank">longer growing season</a>.
  The woody matter helps to keep nutrient excess from passing into the 
ground water - and then refeeding that to your garden plants later.  
Plus, by holding SO much water, hugelkultur could be part of a system 
for <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3961_0/permaculture/urban-desert-permaculture" target="_blank">growing garden crops in the desert with no irrigation</a>.</p>

<p>I do think there are some considerations to keep in mind.  For example, I don't think I would use <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3961_0/permaculture/urban-desert-permaculture" target="_blank">cedar</a>.  Cedar lasts so
long because it is loaded with <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/6970_0/permaculture/the-myth-of-allelopathic-wood-chipswood-chips-made-from-cedars-will-kill-plants" target="_blank">natural pesticides/herbicides/anti-fungal/anti-microbial</a> (remember, good soil has lots of fungal and microbial stuff).  Not a good mix for <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3904_0/permaculture/grow-tomatoes-without-irrigation-or-fertilizer" target="_blank">tomatoes</a> or melons, eh?  Black locust, black cherry,
black walnut?  These woods have issues.  <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/224_0/woodland-care/what-makes-black-locust-last-so-long-is-it-safe-for-gardens" target="_blank">Black locust</a> won't rot - I think because it is so dense.  <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/1249_0/organic-sustainable-practices/juglone-planting-under-walnuts" target="_blank">Black walnut</a> is very toxic to most plants, and <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/8771_0/organic-sustainable-practices/the-best-cherry-varieties">cherry</a>
 is toxic to animals, but it might be okay when it rots - but I wouldn't
 use it until I had done the research.  Known excellent woods are: <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/5978_0/woodland-care/the-value-of-alder-alnus-glutinosa" target="_blank">alders</a>, <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/998_0/permaculture/growing-apples-from-seeds-vs-cloning" target="_blank">apple</a>, <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3603_0/woodland-care/about-cottonwood-trees">cottonwood</a>, <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2497_0/woodland-care/poplar-good-for-what">poplar</a>,
 willow (dry) and birch.  I suspect maples would be really good too, but
 am not certain.  Super rotten wood is better than slightly aged wood.  
The best woods are even better when they have been cut the same day 
(this allows you to "seed" the wood with your choice of fungus - shitake
 mushrooms perhaps?).</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that wood is high in carbon and will consume nitrogen to do the compost thing.
This could lock up the nitrogen and take it away from your growies.  But well rotted wood doesn't do this so much.  If
the wood is far enough along, it may have already taken in sooooo much nitrogen, that it is now putting it out!</p>

<p>Pine and fir will have some levels of tanins in them, but I'm guessing that most of that will be gone when the wood has
been dead for a few years.</p>

<p>In the drawings at right, the artist is trying to show that while the
 wood decomposes and shrinks, the leaves, duff and accumulating organic 
matter from above will take it's place.  The artist is showing the new 
organic matter as a dark green.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:25px; margin-top:2px; text-align:center;"><b>raised garden beds dug in a bit -<br>plus paths are dug on the sides and<br>that sod/soil goes on top too</b></p>


</div>

<p>I find I most often build hugelkultur in places where the soil is 
shallow.  So I end up finding excess soil from somewhere else on the 
property and piling it on some logs.  Presto!  Instant raised garden 
beds!  This is usually the easiest/fastest way too.  Especially if you 
have earth moving equipment.</p>

<p>For those times that the soil is deep and you are moving the soil by 
hand, I like to dig up the sod and dig down a foot or two.  Then pile in
 the wood.  Then put the sod on top of the wood, upside-down.  Then pile
 the topsoil on top of that.  Even better is to figure out where the 
paths will be, and dig down there too.  Add two layers of sod onto the 
logs and then the double topsoil.</p>

<p>I have discovered that a lot of people are uncomfortable with the 
idea of raised bed gardens.  They have seen the large flat gardens for 
years and are sure this is the way to do it.  Some people are okay with 
raised beds that are three to six inches tall - they consider anything 
taller than that unsightly.  </p>

<p>So this is gonna sound crazy, but I hope to convince you that the crazy-sounding stuff is worth it.</p>

<p>If you build your hugelkultur raised garden beds tall enough, you 
won't have to irrigate.  At all (after the second year).  No hoses.  No 
drip system.  Anything shorter won't require as much irrigation - so 
there is still some benefit. Imagine going on vacation in the summer 
without having to hire somebody to <s>kill</s> water your garden! As a further bonus, the flavor of everything you grow will be far better!</p>

<p>To go all summer long without a drop of rain, you need to build your 
hugelkultur raised bed gardens .... six feet tall.  But they'll shrink! 
 Mostly in the first month.  Which is why I suggest you actually build 
them seven feet tall.</p>

<p>Hugelkultur raised garden beds can be built just two feet tall and 
will hold moisture for about three weeks.  Not quite as good, but more 
within the comfort zone of many people - including urban neighbors.</p>

<p>Some people will start out with hugelkultur raised garden beds that 
are two and a half feet tall and plant only annuals.  And each year they
 will build the size of the bed a foot.  So that after a few years, they
 will have the bigger beds and the neighbors never really noticed.  And 
if they've tasted what comes from it - they might be all for it without 
caring about the big mounds.</p>

<p>Besides, isn't this much better use of the wood than hauling it to 
the dump, or chipping it, or putting it in those big city bins for yard 
waste?</p>

<h2 id="comparison">different kinds of hugel beds</h2>
</header>

<content>

<p>I usually build hugelkulture raised garden beds about five feet wide.
  This makes for some mighty steep beds.  Just pack that soil on tight 
and plant it with a mix of heavy rooted plants to hold it all together. 
 Quick! Before it rains!  If you are going to build beds shorter than 
three feet tall, I suggest that you make the beds no wider than four 
feet wide.  Unless you are doing  <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/6518_0/permaculture/starting-a-key-hole-garden" target="_blank">keyhole style raised garden beds</a>, in which case you should be able to get away with something wider.</p>

	<p>This DVD is part of a 3 DVD set called World Domination Gardening. 
In this DVD we talk about hugelkultur and terraces. This location gets 
frost in the winter and can be really hot in the summer. A lot of the 
surrounding area looks very desert like. We decide to make a hugelkultur
 bed shaped into a sun scoop. And the angle of the slope is optimized to
 the level of the sun in winter. We also talk about how swales are 
excellent at creating frost pockets which works to your advantage in the
 summer. What type of wood and different variations for hugelkultur are 
covered. A terrace is constructed to hold the hugelkultur bed.</p>

<p>The hugelkultur raised garden beds below were built in an urban lot 
between the curb and the sidewalk (sometimes called a parking strip).  
The final raised garden bed is about two feet tall.  The beds are about 
six feet wide with keyholes.  There is rotted maple on the inside and 
black locust (will rot in about 70 years) on the outside:</p>

three foot tall bed and how little water the riparian species need:

<p>Here is sod that was piled in the spring and had some tomato plants 
stuck in it.  It was not irrigated all summer.  The tomatoes not only 
survived, but they are delicious.  Winter frost should hit any day.</p>

<h2 id="FAQ">hugelkultur raised beds FAQ</h2>
</header>

<content>

<p><b>My HOA won't allow anything like that, what do I do?  (my neighbors would freak out, what do I do?)</b>
</p>

<p>There are many possibilities.  Some people dig a trench five feet 
deep, fill that with organic matter and have something that is either 
flush with the surface or it appears to be only one foot tall (which is 
in the comfort zone of neighbors and HOA folk).  Other people will build
 something that is 18 inches high the first year, and add a foot each 
year.  Still others will have so many neighbors build them all at once 
that it is difficult the buck the tide.  And then there is always the 
back yard.</p>

<p><b>I have standing trees that are about to be cut down.  I don't want
 to have a bunch of logs sitting around until they are old to be used 
for raised garden beds.  What do I do?</b></p>

<p>The wood doesn't have to be old to be used. In fact, it is even better when fresh!</p>

<p><b>Do I need a wood chipper/shredder?</b></p>

<p>No.  This style of raised garden beds works much better if the wood is not chipped.  So much more peaceful and less smelly too!</p>

<p><b>How do I till it every spring?</b></p>

<p>Once the raised garden bed is built, you don't ever till it.  As the 
wood breaks down inside the bed, it will sorta-kinda till its insides 
itself.  And with a really tall, really steep raised garden bed, nobody 
will step on it, so the soil will not become compacted.</p>

<p><b>I'm 81 years old. Does this make gardening less work?</b></p>

<p>More work to set up.  But less work as the years pass.  Planting and 
harvesting should be easier since you won't have to bend down as much.  
On the second year and beyond, all irrigation and fertilization will be 
eliminated - so that's less work.  When combined with permaculture and 
polyculture techniques, you can even eliminate planting seeds, so that 
in the end, all you ever do is harvest.</p>

<p><b>What will this do to the flavor of the food?</b></p>

<p>It will make for stronger flavor.  Especially for fruits.  Expect far more flavor in tomatoes and berries.</p>

<h2 id="largescale">large scale hugelkultur</h2>
</header>
<content>
	<p>So I guess a person could think of the wood used in hugelkultur as "wild compost"!  Available in twig, stick and log
sizes!</p>

<p>So I popped on out to my local hugelkultur store and I saw this:</p>

<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/pile.jpg">

<p>Yummy!  I'm guessing that somebody did some thinning and stacked this to use for firewood in the future.  Only they
never came back and got it.  So the years passed and the wood rotted ...</p>

<p>I took most of it and put it on my tractor:</p>

<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/pile_b.jpg">
<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/pile_tractor.jpg">

<p>I left stuff that was so rotten that it would not transport well.  Besides, it's going to do some good for the forest if
not for my raised beds.</p>

<p>Instant raised bed!  Just lay down wood, and cover with dirt!  That's all there is to it!  Just two easy steps!</p>

<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/bed_a.jpg">
<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/bed_b.jpg">
<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/bed_c.jpg">
<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/bed_d.jpg">
<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/bed_e.jpg">
<img src="hugelkultur_%20the%20ultimate%20raised%20garden%20bed_files/bed_f.jpg">




<p>That's a hurky big bed!  It will probabably be about 1/3 the size a year from now.  Then we'll place rocks around it and
rework it a little into a slightly more elegant raised bed.  This year:  potatoes!</p>

		<h2 id="micro-doc">micro Documentary on hugelkultur for gardeners</h2>
	</header>
	<content>
		<p>Bart and I created a micro documentary for all of the supporters. 
It is animation rich, and a very polished, professional creation. Topics
 covered include:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> How to shape your landscape to be warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.
		</li><li>Encouraging diversity inside the hugelkultur as well as outside.
		</li><li>Organic vs. Permaculture 
		</li></ul>
		
		<p>While the full 3-DVD set is for urban gardeners as well as people 
with acreage, and the full 3-DVD set will contain far more information 
on hugelkultur, this micro documentary will be focused on gardening and 
have no focus on projects with larger acreage.</p>

					Trash Magic is a game of MUTUAL AID quests. We want to have strong communities and live well. Many of us are suffering from financial challenges, loss of community, and meaningless lifestyles. Consumer-based economics has generated an unfathomable amount of second-hand materials. By taking this opportunity to design useful things out of free materials, we believe that <i>we can live in a society that costs no money to build and maintain</i>. When good things made for free contain instructions so that other people can copy them for free, we replace a culture of ownership and scarcity with a culture of replication and abundance.

Any page in this system can be copied and shared. No matter which blueprint you copy or how many, every single one will contain all the necessary instructions for anyone else who stumbles along any single page to not only copy the entire digital network of information, but also to build a free and healthy community in the real world.

					We define Trash Magic in 3 ways.
					<br>
					<br>				
					Trash Magic is: (1) good for the community, (2) made for free, and (3) holds instructions to (a) copy, (b) change, and (c) recycle itself
					<br>
					<br>
					(1) GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY:
					<br>
					If a helpful thing can be created and used by individuals sustainably without exploitation, or if it is accessible, sustainable, and useful for the community at large, then it is good for the community.
					<br>
					<br>
					(2) MADE FOR FREE:
					<br>
					Ideally, the thing is upcycled from used materials. If it is sustainably sourced from nature, this is okay too. It's even normal to spend a little money to get basic tools. But if something is too expensive or rare for most people to get, or too complicated for most people to use, then it will not replicate very easily. We want everything that we create to be easy for others to copy, because we love to share and we want everyone to be happy and healthy and have what we have.
					<br><br>
					We are scaling this system at a "negative marginal cost", which means that the more we make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff (sharing our blueprints openly as we do so), the easier it becomes for everyone else to make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff. We create social networks and communities in which any person helping to build a free society can share their projects with everyone else, so everyone benefits. For the first time in history, our planet is covered with perfectly good stuff that nobody wants just because it's not "brand new". Everything has already been mined out of the ground, woven, molded, purified, shaped, welded, and otherwise assembled into a useful form. The tools needed to work with these resources are now widespread, as well.
					<br>
					<br>
					(3) HOLDS INSTRUCTIONS:
					<br>
					Everything we make should be easy to use and copy. The copying instructions or a hyperlink to them should be physically connected to the thing itself. The instructions should be easy to find and understand. The blueprints and assembly should be designed in a way that makes the thing easy to modify and adapt to new situations and needs. It should also contain information on how it can be taken apart without destroying it and how the individual parts can be reused in new projects.
					<br><br>
					This continual reuse becomes its Lore. The Story of an artifact becomes the factor which determines its value (in contrast to the price). Mythic Quests are fulfilled through Trash Magic. This Story should be infused with the Instructions for further Magick. The Instructions of replication should be taught through symbols that tell The Story of its Lore.
					<br><br>
					Everything should copy easily because the replication instructions are literally right in your hands. The replication instructions should also hold an overview of the Trash Magic system (just like the one that you're reading now). This allows us to share not only our creations themselves, but the goals of the overarching system of Trash Magic.

				You "win" the game when your community has free and open access to a COMPLETE SET, which is a human network that meets all the following physical and social needs:
				<br><br>
				PHYSICAL HUMAN NEEDS
				<br>• Food
				<br>• Clean water
				<br>• Disposal of human waste
				<br>• Tools
				<br>• Buildings with Temperature Control: the air of indoor environments should have heat and cooling of some kind, these shelters should be constructed in such a way that this needs minimal...
				<br>• Energy (use natural heat and coolness from the environment)
				<br>• Communication / networking / controls / automation / audio / video / simulations: these are the real reasons we need “computers”
				<br>• Medicine and drugs
				<br><br>
				SOCIAL HUMAN NEEDS
				<br>• Generalized and Specific Social Supports
				<br>• Accessibility to participate in and opportunities to contribute to society
				<br>• Therapy and Counseling
				<br>• Social and communal places, 3rd places, walkable communities, etc.
				<br>• Access to Trash Magic Networks, which of course should include all of this
				<br><br>
				All of these needs count as their own SET. For example, the FOOD SET is a collection of techniques for cultivating, finding, or preparing foods. When you begin building communities and infrastructure in the real world, it might start small. But as you grow, you will soon have more and more items in each SET. Eventually you will be able to provide for these needs without financial challenges, lack of community, or meaningless lifestyles. When all of your SETS are filled with techniques that meet human needs in free, communal, and meaningful ways, you have a COMPLETE SET. Congratulations! Now it's time to RECYCLE and REPLICATE.
				<br><br>
				Replication Quests plant the seeds of the entire Trash Magic system. Replication Quests are about giving things away for free. You don't need to have a COMPLETE SET to do this. You just have to give something away for free. When the thing has copying instructions attached, anyone who receives it can recreate that particular thing or the entire Trash Magic system. You can also take things apart and spread the separate pieces, making sure that each individual piece contains all the copying instructions. To do this, first make a thing. Then RECYCLE it by detaching it into separate parts and pass them along to different people who you hope will REPLICATE the whole thing for free.
				<br><br>
				If, for example, the item is made from five parts, then each person who gets one of the five parts can use the copying instructions attached to rebuild the other four parts for free to make their own copy of that item. Another way to do this is to have a team of five people. They assemble to complete a task, then all five go out to find four new members for five new teams. Both of these examples show how to replicate one thing into five. Hyperseeds are any parts of any COMPLETE SET that can evolve itself into a healthy community in the real world by using free parts from its surroundings.

					You can start wherever you feel most excited or comfortable. Here are three starter quests which are often recommended. Feel free to skip around as needed:
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your first quest is to replicate the Trash Magic Trilogy, read the Trash Magic Manifesto, and upload these books to archive.org and github.com, as well as any other online or offline databases or hosting pages you use. Please use tags like TRASH MAGIC, SELF-REPLICATION, GEOMETRY, UPCYCLING, and COMMUNITY when you do so. Save a copy on a usb drive. Email a copy to yourself and your friends. You can download these books by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the page or this link: <a href="https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a>. 
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your second quest is to create your own set of online documents just like this one, which can be accessed by anyone online at https://[your_username].github.io. You can download-replicate any blueprint from this system by right-clicking on the page, then selecting 'SAVE PAGE AS' (you can do this on any website). You can download-replicate the entire system with the button at the bottom of the page (it's currently less than 60 MB). Upload your set of blueprints to your github profile under a repository called [your_username] (name your homepage index.html). Upload a copy to archive.org, etc. Print a copy for offline reference: <a href="print_friendly_footer.html">HERE</a> is a link to the minified version of these explanations for easier printing.
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your third quest is to make physical hyperlinks, called hyperseeds. Replicate them by writing your github.io url on cardboard shapes or other free materials, along with the words TRASH MAGIC, and a QR code which points to the url. Include colorful geometric drawings such as a golden pentagram or a unicursal hexagram. Then give these to others or leave them to be found. Make them beautiful. All Trash Magic is art!
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your next quests are entirely up to you!

				Trash means free materials and Magic means the desire to replicate using instructions. RNA Polymerase does something like Trash Magic. The Magician and their desire to replicate a set are always two of the elements of the set itself. What we are doing inspires <i>desire</i> in us, the desire to participate in the great wonder of Life and Self-Replication. We also desire to live well and be happy and see our community members doing the same. Trash Magic is meant to be inherent in everything that we create. Trash Magic is both Art and Technology that moves us with a kind of reverence to Replicate and Recycle. Thus, the name "Trash Magic" refers to the excitement and wonder of playing the game and participating in Life Itself.
