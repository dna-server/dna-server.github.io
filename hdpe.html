<title>Plastic Fabrication</title>

<h1 id="pageName">Plastic Fabrication</h1>

originally shared @ <a href="https://lafelabs.github.io/hdpe.html">https://lafelabs.github.io/hdpe.html</a>
<br>

3d printers are not a path to free technology.  If you go buy one at 
Home Depot, you have to buy a spool of plastic to go with it that costs 
more than many of the finished products made of much higher quality 
plastic also available, such as chairs and snow shovels.  Then when  you
 print things the quality is extremely low, the software is often 
frustrating and broken, the thing you make cannot then be remade with 
that hardware, it must be sent off to some factory for recycling when 
you're done with it(or more likely buried with everything else).  And 
they're full of patents, making the whole technology fairly broken for 
anyone looking to make useful things without helping a few technocrats 
get even richer.  And at several hundred dollars minimum cost they're 
hardly a mass market product, even if rich "tech" people all buy them in
 droves(and then print 5 things and never use them again).  

<p> 
The opposite extreme for plastics manufacturing in terms of scale is 
injection molding, by far the most practical means of manufacturing with
 plastics in bulk.  This is very low cost for high volume but insanely 
high cost at low volume, with a minimum investment for a mold being a 
few thousand dollars or a few tens of thousands.  Making a new mold 
takes time, energy, skills, and is difficult to automate due to the 
craft aspects of getting the mold right.  It can take a few tries to get
 the correct mold design which is expensive in both time and energy and 
money.  This is also not relevant for truly free technology for several 
reasons: scale breaks at small number, it requires high levels of 
technical expertise, it's energy intensive, requires that high quality 
metals machining also exist along side it to make the molds, and again 
cannot be edited after being cast.  One can recycle it easily, yes, but 
not edit or repair an existing part.

</p><p>

The other major technology for manufacturing plastics which is mostly 
not used at scale but is useful for prototyping is CNC machining.  This 
can make high quality parts fast, but is very expensive, needs heavy 
fixed infrastructure, is hard to build from trash, and needs a lot of 
specialized expertise.  

</p><p>

My methods of plastic fabrication involve abandoning the paradigms of 
both additive(3d printing) and subtractive manufacturing(CNC), by 
converting a feedstock of mixed plastic trash into useful industrial 
products by cutting(not melting or shredding) them up into standard 
geometric shapes, then using heat welding and simple manipulation tools 
like tweezers and pliers to create three dimensional parts from 2 
dimensional components. As with 3d printing, this can be used to make 
either mostly hollow structures or structures reinforced with an 
arbitrarily high density of structural lattices(typically honeycomb for 
most 3d printing systems).  

</p><p>
I have been experimenting with various plastic trash feedstocks and have
 found that HDPE and LDPE(high and low density polyethylene) are by far 
the most tractable with these methods.  In theory this can be extended 
to any thermoplastic, such as PMMA, ABS or PP, but for now I'm using 
HDPE and LDPE for all work here as those are easy to work with by hand 
and easy to find both in litter in the environment and in my personal 
trash feedstock based on the milk I consume daily with my breakfast 
cereal.  Most milk containers are made from HDPE, as well as a lot of 
bottle caps for PP bottles(which I've found very frustrating to work 
with but the caps are great).  The big orange traffic barriers(not 
cones) which can often be found trashed in urban swamp areas after they 
get hit by trucks, smashed and kicked off the highway are also a great 
source of LDPE.  
</p><p>

At present my method is extremely simple: I cut plastic milk bottles up 
with a box cutter, wash them in a sink cut them into shapes with 
scissors, then use tweezers and a candle flame to make the weld joints. 
 I developed these methods initially using a hot air gun with 
temperature control set to 130 C which makes the process much easier but
 have found that with practice the candle or even a lighter can be used 
just as well. Milk bottle work all calls for tweezers, and I use very 
flat bladed ones from the eye makeup section of the grocery store or 
pharmacy, which are intended for eyelash related work(hence the flat 
blades).  

</p><p>

I have documented some of the processes for building useful stuff with these methods on Instructables and Youtube:

</p><ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Fluid-Tube-From-Plastic-Bottle/">tube for fluidics/plumbing</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/TrashCoil1/">Fabricating motor coil using welded HDPE</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJY9uVnHG7o&amp;t=23s">Video of making a motor coil spool from milk bottle</a></li>
</ul>

In addition to spools for motor coils, I've experimented with various 
objects made from HDPE using simple geometry(all from Action Geometry, 
and to be eventually documented in Geometron) which can be used for 
plumbing, fluidics, and optics(reflectors and light shields for bike 
lights and microscope illuminators).  I've also made useful bike parts 
using welded LDPE at a larger scale(a cup holder for my handlebars.)
<p>
Unlike 3d printed parts it has proven to be easy to cut up and reform or
 just make small modifications to existing parts.  I have also used HPDE
 bottle caps as structural elements for electronic circuits, and then 
integrated those via welds into various motor coil geometries.  It's 
also relatively easy to integrate this into cardboard fabrication 
techniques from Action Geometry, making various tabs and slots as 
needed, and welding things into place.  Finally I've found that 
connecting plastic parts with wood is simple without threaded fasteners 
or nails or wire by cutting holes into sticks and shoving glassy plastic
 into the holes, which harden into fasteners which can be easily broken 
off later and reformed.  

</p><p>

</p><h4>The next things that need to happen on this project are:</h4>


<ul>
	<li>More motor coils of all sizes with better documentation</li>
	<li>use motor manipulators to automate weld process</li>
	<li>use motor manipulators to automate harvesting of milk bottles</li>
	<li>finish "Fire Elemental" and set it up as a microscopy platform</li>
	<li>Build and test pumps using HDPE fluidics</li>
	<li>Extend fluidic system to include valves, reversible pumps etc. to make complete fluidic set, with electrical probes</li>
	<li>Finish building dodecahedral HDPE aluminum/carbon battery cell, test, improve, etc.</li>
	<li>Develop curriculum and standard tool set to enable more rapid transmission of methods to other humans</li>
	<li>expand online content to extend same</li>
</ul>  


<h4>Applications Within Existing Society</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Fabrication of plumbing parts in emergencies and disasters</li>
	<li>Fabrication of all kinds of parts by US military personell in the field</li>
	<li>Replacement for 3d printing in art/hobby fabrication</li>
	<li>Microfluidics(HDPE fab should scale down to micron scale easily)/</li><li>
	</li><li>Pumps that can be repaired from trash for sustainable development in "developing world"</li>
	<li>plastic enclosures which can be sealed then re-sealed for growing fungi</li>
	<li>editable electronics enclosures</li>

				<h1>WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?</h1>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="box-container">
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					Trash Magic is a game of MUTUAL AID quests. We want to have strong communities and live well. Many of us are suffering from financial challenges, loss of community, and meaningless lifestyles. Consumer-based economics has generated an unfathomable amount of second-hand materials. By taking this opportunity to design useful things out of free materials, we believe that <i>we can live in a society that costs no money to build and maintain</i>. When good things made for free contain instructions so that other people can copy them for free, we replace a culture of ownership and scarcity with a culture of replication and abundance.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<! -- -->
		<div class="box-container">
			<div class="box">
				Why does every Trash Magic blueprint in our system include these explanations? Reflect on how every cell in a body contains the DNA to replicate that entire body. Any page in this system can be copied and shared. No matter which blueprint you copy or how many, every single one will contain all the necessary instructions for anyone else who stumbles along any single page to not only copy the entire digital network of information, but also to build a free and healthy community in the real world.
				<br><br>
				This system currently lives at <a href="https://dna-server.github.io" target="_blank">https://dna-server.github.io</a>
			</div>

		<div class="box-container">
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					We define Trash Magic in 3 ways.
					<br>
					<br>				
					Trash Magic is: (1) good for the community, (2) made for free, and (3) holds instructions to (a) copy, (b) change, and (c) recycle itself
					<br>
					<br>
					(1) GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY:
					<br>
					If a helpful thing can be created and used by individuals sustainably without exploitation, or if it is accessible, sustainable, and useful for the community at large, then it is good for the community.
					<br>
					<br>
					(2) MADE FOR FREE:
					<br>
					Ideally, the thing is upcycled from used materials. If it is sustainably sourced from nature, this is okay too. It's even normal to spend a little money to get basic tools. But if something is too expensive or rare for most people to get, or too complicated for most people to use, then it will not replicate very easily. We want everything that we create to be easy for others to copy, because we love to share and we want everyone to be happy and healthy and have what we have.
					<br><br>
					We are scaling this system at a "negative marginal cost", which means that the more we make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff (sharing our blueprints openly as we do so), the easier it becomes for everyone else to make self-replicating stuff out of free stuff. We create social networks and communities in which any person helping to build a free society can share their projects with everyone else, so <i>everyone benefits</i> <b>exponentially</b>. For the first time in history, our planet is covered with perfectly good stuff that nobody wants just because it's not "brand new". Everything has already been mined out of the ground, woven, molded, purified, shaped, welded, and otherwise assembled into a useful form. The tools needed to work with these resources are now widespread, as well.
					<br>
					<br>
					(3) HOLDS INSTRUCTIONS:
					<br>
					Everything we make should be easy to use and copy. The copying instructions or a hyperlink to them should be physically connected to the thing itself. The instructions should be easy to find and understand. The blueprints and assembly should be designed in a way that makes the thing easy to modify and adapt to new situations and needs. It should also contain information on how it can be taken apart without destroying it and how the individual parts can be reused in new projects.
					<br><br>
					This continual reuse becomes its Lore. The Story of when and how an artifact has been used becomes part of its value. Mythic Quests are fulfilled through Trash Magic. This Story can be infused with the Instructions for further Magick. Imagine how magical it would be to teach The Instructions of replication through Storytelling.
					<br><br>
					Everything should copy easily because the replication instructions are literally right in your hands. The replication instructions should also hold an overview of the Trash Magic system (just like the one that you're reading now). This allows us to share not only our creations themselves, but the goals of the overarching system of Trash Magic.

			<div class="box">
				You "win" the game when your community has free and open access to a COMPLETE SET, which is a human network that meets all the following physical and social needs:
				<br><br>
				PHYSICAL HUMAN NEEDS
				<br>• Food
				<br>• Clean water
				<br>• Disposal of human waste
				<br>• Tools
				<br>• Buildings with Temperature Control: the air of indoor environments should have heat and cooling of some kind, these shelters should be constructed in such a way that this needs minimal...
				<br>• Energy (use natural heat and coolness from the environment)
				<br>• Communication / networking / controls / automation / audio / video / simulations: these are the real reasons we need “computers”
				<br>• Medicine and drugs
				<br><br>
				SOCIAL HUMAN NEEDS
				<br>• Generalized and Specific Social Supports
				<br>• Accessibility to participate in and opportunities to contribute to society
				<br>• Therapy and Counseling
				<br>• Social and communal places, 3rd places, walkable communities, etc.
				<br>• Access to Trash Magic Networks, which of course should include all of this
				<br><br>
				All of these needs count as their own SET. For example, the FOOD SET is a collection of techniques for cultivating, finding, or preparing foods. When you begin building communities and infrastructure in the real world, it might start small. But as you grow, you will soon have more and more items in each SET. Eventually you will be able to provide for these needs without financial challenges, lack of community, or meaningless lifestyles. When all of your SETS are filled with techniques that meet human needs in free, communal, and meaningful ways, you have a COMPLETE SET. Congratulations! Now it's time to RECYCLE and REPLICATE.
				<br><br>
				Replication Quests plant the seeds of the entire Trash Magic system. Replication Quests are about giving things away for free. You don't need to have a COMPLETE SET to do this. You just have to give something away for free. When the thing has copying instructions attached, anyone who receives it can recreate that particular thing or the entire Trash Magic system. You can also take things apart and spread the separate pieces, making sure that each individual piece contains all the copying instructions. To do this, first make a thing. Then RECYCLE it by detaching it into separate parts and pass them along to different people who you hope will REPLICATE the whole thing for free.
				<br><br>
				If, for example, the item is made from five parts, then each person who gets one of the five parts can use the copying instructions attached to rebuild the other four parts for free to make their own copy of that item. Another way to do this is to have a team of five people. They assemble to complete a task, then all five go out to find four new members for five new teams. Both of these examples show how to replicate one thing into five. Hyperseeds are any parts of any COMPLETE SET that can evolve itself into a healthy community in the real world by using free parts from its surroundings.

					You can start wherever you feel most excited or comfortable. Here are three starter quests which are often recommended. Feel free to skip around as needed:
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your first quest is to replicate the Trash Magic Trilogy, read the Trash Magic Manifesto, and upload these books to archive.org and github.com, as well as any other online or offline databases or hosting pages you use. Please use tags like TRASH MAGIC, SELF-REPLICATION, GEOMETRY, UPCYCLING, and COMMUNITY when you do so. Save a copy on a usb drive. Email a copy to yourself and your friends. You can download these books by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the page or this link: <a href="https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">https://github.com/dna-server/trash-magic-trilogy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a>. 
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your second quest is to create your own set of online documents just like this one, which can be accessed by anyone online at https://[your_username].github.io. You can download-replicate any blueprint from this system by right-clicking on the page, then selecting 'SAVE PAGE AS' (you can do this on any website). You can download-replicate the entire system with the button at the bottom of the page (it's currently less than 60 MB). Upload your set of blueprints to your github profile under a repository called [your_username] (name your homepage index.html). Upload a copy to archive.org, etc. Print a copy for offline reference: <a href="print_friendly_footer.html">HERE</a> is a link to the minified version of these explanations for easier printing.
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your third quest is to make physical hyperlinks, called hyperseeds. Replicate them by writing your github.io url on cardboard shapes or other free materials, along with the words TRASH MAGIC, and a QR code which points to the url. Include colorful geometric drawings such as a golden pentagram or a unicursal hexagram. Then give these to others or leave them to be found. Make them beautiful. All Trash Magic is art!
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					Your next quests are entirely up to you!

				Trash means free materials and Magic means the desire to replicate using instructions. RNA Polymerase does something like Trash Magic. The Magician and their desire to replicate a set are always two of the elements of the set itself. What we are doing inspires <i>desire</i> in us, the desire to participate in the great wonder of Life and Self-Replication. We also desire to live well and be happy and see our community members doing the same. Trash Magic is meant to be inherent in everything that we create. Trash Magic is both Art and Technology that moves us in a wave of awe to Replicate and Recycle. Thus, the name "Trash Magic" refers to the excitement and wonder of playing the game and participating in Life Itself.
