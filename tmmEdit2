231Chapter 1CapitalismWhat is best in life?To care for one another, and to have adventures.
Technology can help us do both of these things, building societies where all physical needs are taken care ofas well as which preserve the adventure that makes lifeworth living.
However, as technology has advanced ithas increasingly served its own needs.
Because it hashad such a powerful overall positive effect on the humancondition(in some material ways), we have allowed therules of technical progress to dictate the rules of the restof our society.
In this chapter I discuss how I view capitalism as an underlying force which drives this process,creating great suffering for humanity and the rest of theliving world.
12 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMWhat is Capitalism?What is capitalism? This is something that critics of itavoid a lot of the time to their detriment.
If you lookup various definitions, it generally goes something likethis: “Capitalism is the economic system in which themeans of production are privately owned.
” I hate thisdefinition, and I think it’s held back our collective effortto fight it for the last 150 years.
What this definition implies is that the opposite ofcapitalism is someone other than “the private owners” or“the capitalists” owning the “means of production”, and“economics” being based on something other than privatecapital.
I put all these things in scare quotes because Isee them all as subtle weapons to inject hidden ideologyinto peoples minds by the very wording of the definition.
First of all, the anarchist rejection of capitalism rejectsownership of minerals, land, and machines.
So any definition that talks about “who owns what” should already berejected by the critic of capitalism, and we have alreadyceded a major point by allowing this definition to standat all unexamined.
Capitalism is a system in which somepeople, called “owners”, claim to have power over certainthings, which they claim the right to carry out by force ifneeded.
Capitalism is also a system in which a militarystate exists which both feeds of the system of privatelyowned extraction and enforces the power structure thatgoverns it.
3The “means of production” is also a problematic phrase.
While it is a bit ambiguous, I see this phrase as at leastpotentially implying that this the “means” is some sort offixed infrastructure.
The implication is that “the meansof production” is a thing that exists outside of economicsystems, which can be controlled by any of various typesof government or state.
This is false.
The very structureof “production” in today’s society is what I would callcapitalism.
The Soviet system, the various fascist systems, “democracies”, dictatorships, monarchies, I wouldsay every single one of them is capitalist.
They all havethis basic structure of military power creating a monopolyof force that protects a vast system to extract mineralwealth and destroy it as fast as possible by constantthreat of violence.
To me calls to “seize the means ofproduction” sound like calls against a king to go seizethe palace and tell the king what to do but to keep thepalace and king in place.
It’s the same system, with slightchanges.
So to let the capitalists define these ideas givesthem a victory before a debate even begins: it allowsthat the existing “means of production” should continueto exist without discussion.
A true challenge to capitalism is one in which the very concept of production isreinvented.
It means building industrial technology fromthe ground up around different values.
Another problem is with the notion of “economic system”.
I would argue that economics is again a part ofthe intellectual descendent of the basic idea of the One4 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMGod of monotheists.
There is a Universal Hierarchy thatexists, which allows numbers to be used to assign valueto things.
Human value becomes a number, always eitherless than or greater than or equal to any other numericalhuman value.
Part of rejecting the basic ideas of capitalism is to reject this hierarchy cast down from God.
Butto even use the phrase “economic system” again lets capitalism be defined in a universe in which nothing otherthan capitalism exists.
Indeed in some of the definitions I’ve found onlinethey even add phrases like “as opposed to State ownership of the means of production”.
In other words thesupposed definition of capitalism used by most people isnot a definition of capitalism at all, but a clever propaganda piece that creates a world in which the alternativeto capitalism is another type of capitalism which is recast as the Socialist Enemy.
Since I consider all the Soviet style “communist” countries to be capitalist in theirphilosophical worldview, I find it not surprising that theyhold the same warped view of this false dichotomy.
Thecommunists can point to “capitalism” as their enemy,where “the ruling class” “own” the “means of production”, rather than “the dictatorship of the proletariat”.
When this becomes a nightmare like it always does anddestroys the environment even worse than “capitalism”,people on the right say “I told you so” and people on theleft say “it will be different next time! it’s all Stalin’sfault!”.
5So if we really want to move beyond capitalism, criticisms of it need to start trying to really see it for whatit is, and see just how far the viral ideas about God thatunderly it have wormed their ways into the very languagewe use to describe it.
I will give capitalism the following definition:Capitalism is a system of belief in which numbers are used to denote all value.
That, I believe, is the heart of the matter.
And itpoints to why experiments like the USSR have endedup having problems so similar to those in the westerncapitalist world.
In a word, money.
Money is not justmetal or paper or faith in a government, it is the ideathat a number, specifically an integer number(money canusually be subdivided but only up to a point) can beused to denote all human values.
This is why I believethe concept is so slippery, and so hard to break out of.
You can replace dollars with time dollars, bit coin, gold,silver, bags of salt or goldbacked edinar and it’s reallyall the same thing: numbers.
Integer numbers.
As longas there is an exchange rate between a system of valueand an existing currency you have not really broken freeof the current system.
And what is money? The purity of numbers hasproven to be incredibly powerful.
Users of the number based values have literally moved mountains withthe power they have been able to deploy using money.
In particular money based values have been excellent at6 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMFigure 1.
1: Line of tiny subjects worshipping a giantmonument to the Number One7several things, some of which are good but most of whichare bad.
I will now explore the nature of money morespecifically.
The Nature of Capitalist MoneyOur currency is based on two things:1.
suffering2.
and mineralsTurning minerals and human misery into numbers iscapitalism in a nutshell, and is the basis of our monetarysystem.
Capitalism is an industrial system in which all valueis based on human misery and minerals.
By creating misery, some people use threats of violence to control land.
They use more minerals, fire, and misery to create minerals ordered with a precision based on their belief in violence and control through military order(square arrays,long lines of useless pillars, etc.
).
The threat of inflictingmisery using military technology(not only is our technology military, our concept of military is based on ourtechnology as well, and both are based on the One Godbeliefs) is how some people known as capitalists claim“ownership”.
Ownership is a complex network of violentthreats which allow threats of future misery and benefits8 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMFigure 1.
2: Bearded ManGod Looks down on the suffering and minerals in satisfaction9Figure 1.
3: Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it.
That isour economic system in a nutshell10 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMpaid from past misery to be added up numerically, building a ladder of power down which the physical benefitsof mineral wealth slowly trickle, with the most landingat the top.
Any proposal to reform capitalism that maintains concept of numerical adding up of suffering and minerals isjust capitalism with a new mask on.
True reform meansfinding a set of moral values that informs technologicalfigures of merit which are based on human joy, adventure, hilariousness, beauty, or other things that actuallyhave positive value for everyone, and then rebuilds ourwhole concept of what it means to have a technology upfrom scratch.
To repeat: to attempt to reform capitalism while continuing to use any of our current technology at all is alost cause.
The ideas of capitalism are built into the position of every atom in a modern technical artifact.
If youwant a world without capitalism you must re order everyatom, completely re design how atoms go together fromthe bottom up.
And in building this it makes sense toacknowledge that 300400 years of industrial capitalismgave us the gift of minerals, which we can now live onforever.
Every atom.
Every atom changes in how it relates tothe whole.
Same physics, same atoms, but new orderingprinciples, breaking out of the military design concepts.
No more are the ideal shapes always planes, circles, andperfect grid arrays of objects.
No more are tech artifacts11locked into a centrally controlling clock that tells themwhen to work and what to do.
No more is there a wallbetween engineer and customer, where some things areknown and some are secret: all information on construction is physically encoded in the artifact, and updatedas more edits are made, even if the user does not document(data stream into the dataverse).
Capitalism as ReligionCapitalism is the hidden religion.
It does not admit tobeing a religion and its believers(at this point almost allhumans) do not realize they are in this religion but theyare.
Even members of various other religions decry people leaving their flocks for the “secular” world but won’tdirectly name this as a competing religion.
But a religionit is, complete with odd beliefs of all kinds.
In my observation, the beliefs of capitalism include:1.
Private property is sacred2.
All value can be added up using numbers3.
All value must be extracted from the Earth or fromhuman misery4.
Human society is described by something called an“economy”, which is a system for laundering mineproducts and human misery into numerical mediaof exchange5.
Hard work is an intrinsic good12 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISM6.
Our world can all be described by a giant hierarchy,people, animals, objects, gods, ideas, all are alwaysranked and this ranking is ordained by the highestauthority, whatever that is.
I believe that number worship is an underlying hiddenreligion that is integrated into all other modern mainstream capitalist religions.
What is monotheism? It isthe belief that there is only one true god.
But this implies that you can count gods.
That is the underlyingassumption.
It separates parts of the universe that aregod from nongod in a rigid way, breaking up gods orpotential gods into discrete numbers that one can count,rank, and ultimately then put one on top of all others.
From this we get hierarchy of all kinds down through theages and all the horrors of capitalism.
But if you are amonotheist note that your One True God is almost certainly also a universal part of your world.
So what makesyou believe you can count gods? This other, hidden, religion that is required to phrase the questions and answersabout your god using numbers.
So do not take my attacks on the structure of industrial monotheism as anattack on your One God–I do not deny your god, merelyyour ability to count gods.
That being said, I do think this counting has ledto other problems in industrial monotheism which mustbe combated, namely patriarchy.
Monotheistic religionshave a strong tendency to extend the counting hierarchy13from their bearded mangod down to all Things, building an instant patriarchy into their world view.
Don’t dothat!Professionalism: A Capitalist CancerI am against professionalism in all forms.
Professionalismdivides us.
We have split up philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, design, manufacturing, theology, art, andtechnology, and very much to the detriment of them all.
I’m against engineering and design as professions.
Whilespecialization can be useful, I believe our society has created a soulless technopriest class which is evil enoughin its very nature that technology needs to be rebuiltfrom the ground up outside that system.
If your technology needs the techno priests to function, it means yourtechnology is bad and needs to be replaced.
If it needsextraction of raw materials from the earth or any controlover large tracts of land in a centralized way to function itis bad technology and needs to be replaced.
If it requiressecrecy or proprietary control of information and use itis bad technology.
If it can’t function without capitalismit is bad technology and needs to be replaced.
Specialization is fine up to about 100 people then itis a luxury for special projects.
If you need someone whomakes up less than 1% of the population to do somethingyour technology needs a reset and it is bad.
Our goal istotal freedom for 100 people.
14 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMWe need to start over from scratch and build a technology without the existing techno priests which can bebuilt and maintained by anyone with the desire to doso, using waste streams of the old system.
This has tohappen in thousands of parallel tracks in many different fields of applied science and technology.
I will focuson the parts relevant to my area of expertise: appliedphysics.
Capitalism Stifles InnovationPart of what has led me to write this work is my frustration as a professional scientist with how capitalism has,in my view, held back scientific, technical and culturalinnovation by decades if not centuries.
There are several aspects of capitalist ideology whichhave had devastating effects on science.
The first is theobsession with novelty.
This is probably the largest problem, which I would say has gotten progressively worseas science has gotten more advanced over the last 100years or so.
The problem is that in order to be seen asa success in science you need to prove that what you didis really new, and that newness takes priority in valueover almost everything else.
What this does is createa very broken ladder of importance of things to study.
If you have the choice between two experiments whichboth show the same science, and one involves just seawater, dirt, and a mobile phone, and the other involves15a 1 million dollar machine, a trendy new molecule, andsome advanced math using a new computer algorithm,the latter is considered vastly superior.
And this is basedon the ideology of private property, even when legal intellectual property is not involved.
Even in the publicdomain, when a researcher publishes a sufficiently newthing, that thing is attached to their name, and can beturned into real tangible monetary value.
All the elements I describe in the example above shouldbe called out for causing problems with science progress.
First of all, the use of expensive machines.
This notonly makes sure there is a barrier between the work ofthe lab scientists and the general public, it usually increases the distance between the researchers themselvesand the subject matter.
I believe that the purpose ofall science is to create the closest possible link betweenthe human mind and the world we live in.
The moreexpensive your machine, the larger the barrier betweenmind and world.
Expensive machines are great for building capitalist jobs(I’ve had these jobs!) But this is atcross purposes with what should be the goal of simplification.
To eliminate a machine is to eliminate a highpaying technical job, which hurts us as workers in science.
Thus the incentive is opposite of what we want todo, which is always cut down the the size and number ofmachines needed to interact with our world.
Another element of the problems I’ve listed here is the“trendy material” problem.
That is, science is strongly16 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMbiased in favor of newly “discovered” materials over thosewe all know and have access to.
This is created by capitalist ideology because we all need to try to own theproperty, both legally and intellectually, of “new” thingsin order to get the fame required to advance in our careers.
If you prove that “your” substance has a different chemical structure than any that someone else hasstudied, and publish something not very impressive, youcan get famous, and name the molecule.
But if you dosomething impressive, but not really new, on somethingcommon like tap water or ground up moss or a soda can,you have to call it “educational demonstrations” and willnot be taken seriously in high level research circles.
Butagain, this is creating an incentive to do the opposite ofwhat is good for science.
Someone who interacts withtap water or pavement has a connection to much largerfraction of the world than someone who interacts with anobscure form of soot made in a special chamber that onlyexists in their lab.
If our goal is to connect our minds tothe world as well as possible, it’s always better to followthe most common elements of that world, then things wefind around us.
Capitalism pushes the researcher awayfrom those things both because of the need for noveltyand also because the more obscure a molecule is the morelikely it is that a capitalist can make a profit on it.
Aproduct based on a simple recipe with tap water andgravel is worth infinitely less money than one based on acomplex and expensive process.
17The ephemeral concepts of “ownership of ideas” abovepale in evil compared to legal intellectual property.
Thiscould be a whole polemic work of book length on its ownbut suffice it to say that the corrosive effects of excessivepatent and copyright are now so severe that anyone who’sworked at all in science in the last 10 years is alreadypretty upset about this issue.
Even those who claim tosupport the system agree that it’s now so far beyondeven the twisted intent that originally existed that theyare against it in its current form.
However, for the record,my position in this work is that it is pure evil to claimthe concept of ownership over science or technology.
Thescale of the evil is partly escalating as the technology becomes more personal.
As our technology becomes more apart of not just our lives but our selves, we find corporations claiming to legally own parts of our lives and evenour bodies with their patenting of genes both in humansand in our various bacterial neighbors we carry on ourbodies.
Eventually, the property ideologues will, if leftunchecked, build a world where humans are all owned bya consortium of corporations, where we are all literallythe property of corporations and machines.
Science fiction warns of the possibility that a “rise of the machines”will cause us all to become slaves to artificially intelligentmachines, but I would argue that AI is not needed for usto become slaves to machines: humanity is in the processof enslaving ourselves to nonintelligent machines.
I touched on the problem of professionalism already18 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMbut I need to elaborate on this in the context of sciencespecifically.
We have always claimed in philosophy andscience that unification is a goal.
Unification of electricityand magnetism into one theory and then the weak forcein with that are all seen as great triumphs of physics.
Bringing all the atomic elements together into a singleunified periodic table is rightly seen as a great triumphof chemistry, etc.
But in modern applied science we findhuge incentives in the opposite direction of unification.
Because we are all forced to carry out science in the professional system, and there are never enough professionalpositions to go around, those with the good professionaljobs must all jealously guard our positions.
This means abiologist who can do good physics or a physicist who cando good biology are both potential threats to each others’jobs.
Whereas the biologist who creates an even more obscure form of biophysics that gets its own whole new department is the most powerful of all: the unique specialist who owns their field entirely.
The highest salaries andmost honored and secure positions will go to those whodo the opposite of unification.
And sure enough, the lastfew decades have seen a proliferation of tiny subfieldswith their own jargon no one else can read in all fieldsof science.
This has coincided with the rise of extrememarket ideology since the 1970s which drives universitiesto behave more like businesses and research departmentsto behave more like marketing departments.
The corrosive force of capitalism has inflicted a sort of Babel curse19on all science, making it impossible to talk to each otheranymore.
This concept of unification applies in particular tobuilding the tools we use for science.
The most usefultools are the most universal: razor blades, tweezers, optical microscopes, or pliers.
And yet no professional scientist can make a living selling any of those, so we’re notincentivized to make more tools like those.
We can makethem for our own use in our labs, but capitalism directsthose types of tools to be made by the cheapest possible labor, so building them is avoided by the professionalclasses.
Conversely, the tool which only does one thingextremely well can be a perfect monopoly on that thing,creating a large markup and building a comfortable placefor the professional.
Again this is a case of capitalist ideology constantly pushing us all to build the opposite toolfrom what would benefit our fellow scientists or the restof humanity.
These claims are just claims when stated in a a manifesto like this.
I state them without extensive proof because the proof that abandoning capitalism can push science and technology forward much faster has to be byexample.
We must actually go out and do this, buildscience and technology up from scratch on non capitalist principles, without professionalism and without property.
Ultimately this ends up looking more like an artisticmovement(for which a manifesto would be a normal partof the creation process) than a part of science.
Trash20 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMMagic will take many forms in the future, but its initialform will indeed be that of an artistic movement, becausethat’s the simplest way to build things while casting offthe old figures of merit used by engineers and the rest ofthe technocratic priesthood.
Death to Capitalist Math!Math is not objective reality.
This is obvious to most people who don’t do math, as well as to most working mathematicians, but it’s an amazingly popular belief amongtechnocrats.
Math, like any other model built in the human mind, is a sort of reflection of the world.
A verypowerful one, yes, but still just a part of our minds, andlike any other model, there are choices we made to getwhere we are with math which could have been madedifferently.
The example I’ll give here is a paradox that I findparticularly interesting in terms of what it tells us abouthidden ideologies.
Mathematicians call it the BanachTarski paradox, and it generally arises in parts of themath curriculum concerned with point set theory.
Nevermind exactly what that is, it’s something usually taughtin the late undergrad or early grad level in pure math(asopposed to applied math which is not concerned withthese issues).
What this socalled paradox does is create a way toconstruct two spheres of points from the points in one.
21Figure 1.
4: Construction of the Banach Tarski paradoxThat is, all the points in the first sphere are rearrangedin such a way that those same points make two spheresof the same volume as the first.
But how is that a paradox? When dealing with aninfinite number of points, is it really surprising that volume is not preserved? How surprised should we really beabout anything dealing with a truly infinite quantity? Iwould say that this is a “paradox” because it contradictsthe world view of the religion of property and money and22 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMFigure 1.
5: Biological Cells Ignoring Math and Capitalismworship of integer numbers.
Those least surprised by this are people familiar withhow life works.
One of the most important and commonlife processes is cell division, in which a cell simply dividesinto two cells, which end up each being identical to thefirst cell.
This is life! This is how the world around usreally works: things can simply turn into a pair of thingson their own.
Now, the number worshiper will arguethat the cell example is different, that there is a bunchof energy and atoms that have to be absorbed from the23environment for cell division to happen so you are notreally getting something from nothing.
But this is againshowing how oblivious number worshippers are to theirown belief systems, because this all depends on how youdefine things: what is a thing and what is not a thing?It degenerates into nonsense philosophy but suffice it tosay there are many places you can choose to draw thelines, and the worst part of the number worshippers linesis that they don’t even admit they exist.
Why Now?Now is the time for drastic change unique in our history.
Why now in particular?Both the positive and negative sides: danger to humanity is imminent, but also opportunity is greater thanever before because of the vast mineral wealth that iseverywhere and a critical mass of processing and communication technology.
Marx was about 100 years early,and didn’t have access to the information or materials wedo today.
Globalization and Capitalism really have literally sewn the seeds of their own destruction, by creatingseeds for millions of new societies by spreading mineralwealth everywhere around the globe.
The very destruction of capitalism focuses us on thebetter future in several ways.
For one thing, the sections of society most exploited or crushed by capitalismare often also those closest to the massive waste and de24 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMstruction streams of the present system.
Often the poorand dispossessed live near dangerous waste which alsocontains what could be priceless mineral wealth if wehad the technology to bring it back.
Wherever you findthe most oppressed people you will also usually find themost ruined land with the most material waste.
Just likethe people our economy casts aside, these materials oftenexist outside the ownership system, they are claimed byno one and valued negative or not at all by our economicsystem.
But this creates a potential opportunity to buildvery rich new forms of industry that exist without ownership or money: built by people who no one pays, madefrom materials considered “toxic waste” by the ownershipsociety, and given freely to a community who also ownsnothing undermines the entire structure of the existingsystem.
This connection between the people and the materialscast aside is what Trash Magic is really about.
Peoplewho’s time capitalism does not value can use the materials it does not value to truly work magic: to build greatworks of art that we can live off of using the powers ofour minds.

net.
25The primary audience for the first draft is me.
I’mwriting this to be my own guide as I build this technologyout in the physical world and deploy it by gifting it to asmany people as possible.
As that process starts to work,I will go back and make future editions that are gearedtoward a larger number of people.
But for now these arenotes from me to me and those who for some reason seethings as I do.
Note that novelty is not my goal.
I believe that theobsession with novelty in applied science is a toxin ofcapitalism and that by ignoring where ideas come fromand using them as needed, with no expectation of noveltythat much faster and better progress can be made.
Thiswork comes from the heart and mind of one person butnone of that comes from just me: I assume everythingI say here has been said elsewhere and that I’ve beenexposed already to most of what I present here, in variousforms, in books I’ve read or from people I’ve talked to.
I am avoiding a real bibliography very deliberately herefor this very reason.
If it looks like an idea came fromsome source, assume it did.
Even if I didn’t read thatsource, I’m sure I read a book written by someone whodid.
Let’s stop getting worked up about ownership ofideas and worry more about deciding which ideas arereally good enough to keep in the commons.
Also, as stated in the title, this is an activity andcoloring book as well as a manifesto.
That means allillustrations are intended as coloring book pages, to be26 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMcolored in by the reader or their coconspirators.
Theactivities are of several kinds.
One is the “14 contemplations” which are a sort of meditative practice in whichyou both color in a page with a 3d file and stare at certain things in the physical world while contemplating atopic deeply.
They correspond to the 14 chapters of thisbook.
Also, there are some skills in the chapter thattabulates those which may have varying levels of detailin this book but which the reader is encouraged to tryout.
Also, some basic geometry art projects will be partof the skill set and technical construction, which is thefinal of the activities.
Since this is meant to be a bookthat germinates many living technologies, it makes sensethat there should be specific instructions to build certainartifacts.
Since those artifacts remain a work in progresssome of them will be sparsely documented here and willhave more information in future versions, online and inhard copies distributed with the actual artifacts(to begiven away for free in large numbers).
I’m against the machine.
That’s what this is all about.
I hate industrialized society, and I resent that the goodproducts of it are used to hold us all hostage to the totality of The Machine.
The military machine, the capitalistmachine, the consumerist machine, the extraction of rawmaterials machine, the political machine, all of it.
We’retold that if we it’s all or nothing.
Don’t like nuclearbombs? No vaccines for you.
Sick of the Internet giantscontrolling your life? Well, that must mean you like writ27ing letters by hand, you must be a Luddite.
That’s themessage over and over from the mainstream of society.
I challenge all that.
I say that the course of the last300 years of industrial development has not been justfixed by some immutable laws of nature but has in factbeen the product of decisions made which could very wellhave been made differently while still learning how theworld works and how to make useful technology to betternavigate that world.
28 CHAPTER 1.
CAPITALISMFigure 1.
6: First ContemplationFirst Contemplation: Pyramid ofCapitalismIn the first contemplation we contemplate the evils ofcapitalism through the lens of the pyramid, a universalsymbol of that ideology.
Go out in your city and look at the ways capitalismworships itself.
Banks, giant office buildings of corporations, luxury hotels, old parks, and court houses all show29huge mounds of very precisely cut stone as part of thesystem of worship of stone and order that we see in thecapitalist world.
Go stare at them! Marvel at both howbeautiful and majestic they can be and how much evil thealso symbolize with their cold, impersonal stone.
Notethat these stone monuments are almost always accompanied by surveillance cameras, a jarring reminder of whatthey mean in our modern world.
The Contemplation can also be carried out at homeby placing the pyramid in front of a small capitalist artifact, playing the proper music, and vigorously floppingaround on the floor in ALL DIRECTIONS while maintaining eye contact with the pyramid and evil artifact ofcapital.
Chapter 2Free TechnologyWhat Does it Mean for Technology tobe Free?Free means that a thing can be created with only laborand the waste products of the old world or renewableproducts of the natural world, using information that isavailable to the user both physically and logistically.
I will start with a list of what makes technology nonfree.
Since this is a manifesto, it makes sense to call outwhat the problems are that I aim to work on with thisproject.
What does it mean for hardware to be nonfree?• If someone claims the legal right to control who canmake a thing it is not free3031• If materials mined or otherwise extracted from theEarth are needed to make a thing it is not free• If professional expertise that cannot be learned ina short time from clear online instructions are required to make a thing it is not free• If a tool from the consumer capitalist economy isrequired to make a thing(e.
g.
a 3d printer from afactory) it is not free• If the fabrication of a thing requires the use of energy from the Grid or non renewable sources, it isnot free• If a thing cannot be re integrated into the industrialecosystem in a modular way after its lifetime it isnot freeWhat about free technology, what is that?• A free thing can be made from readily availablewaste streams of the existing industrial capitalistsystem• A free thing is not patented and is disclosed publicly in sufficient detail to make patenting it illegal• A free thing has publicly shared non copyrighted instructions which enable a non expert to learn what32 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYthey need to learn to complete the construction ofthe thing• A free thing can be fabricated in a scalable way,from single units up through millions of units, withautomation at large volume using robots built fromsame technology• A free thing uses only ambient energy(includingeasy physical work done by humans) to functionand to be produced• A free thing has a postlifetime trajectory builtinto the design, where all components are easilysalvaged into other Free Things• The construction of a free thing must create valuefrom “nothing”, which can then create value outside the world of numerical currency• An individual thing by itself is free if and only if itis also part of a larger group of technologies, whichI call a “complete technological set”, which can beused to reproduce themselves and to provide allbasic human needs• Free technology does not distinguish between technology and art: it is always both.
33• Free technology naturally reproduces with the helpof people and/or other animals.
If left out somewhere, people will naturally choose to use the thingand information contained in it to make more andto continue the development of that technologicalpath.
What about Open Source?What is the connection between free technology and “opensource hardware”? Open source hardware does not at allhave to be free: it can require a vastly expensive factoryto actually produce, as long as the design is publicly available.
This maintains the power relationships of industrialcapitalism: the means of production remain safely in thehands of the capitalists, we are just rearranging how weshare amongst ourselves.
The difference between free andopen can be more subtle for software where it’s alwaysfree in the sense that it can be copied an infinite numberof times for no cost in principle.
Hardware on the otherhand is not just information.
Without supply chains thatare wrested from the control of the masters of the system, what is or is not free is affected very little by “opensource” hardware.
Another important shortcoming in the open sourcemodel is the lack of demand for the project to be accessible to those outside the technical guild that built it.
Thisis not as bad as it used to be, but it’s still common prac34 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYtice for “open” to mean a thing has horrible documentation and usability as contrasted to “closed” commercialsoftware.
What this really does is further enforce theclass divisions in capitalist society by making a hierarchyof who gets free stuff and who doesn’t.
Those who are inthe software tech guild can get free things that are unusable to a normal person, and which have such opaquehelp files that no one outside the guild can be reasonablyexpected to figure it out.
Avoiding this shortcoming of open source software inthe free hardware project will be a challenge in somecases.
This means that if you want to use something involving the physics of magnets to build a thing, the quality of applied physics education you make available toyour user determines the freeness or non freeness of yourtechnology.
That means that any free electromechanicaltechnology is not really deployed until a whole curriculum is made freely available on classical mechanics andelectrodynamics.
That curriculum must be held to muchhigher standards than are presently applied for college orhigh school physics education.
It must be very applied,with direct numerical examples throughout which can beeasily run by a novice on any computer or phone.
Also itmust be able to cater to a very diverse range of learningstyles: hands on, mathematical, theoretical, visual, etcetc.
All of these must be made freely available in multiple open free formats.
It must be possible to do this withprinted pages and no computer or with any type of com35puter or personal device and no printer(either).
Whenthe thing is built, it must have information printed on itor embedded in some obvious way, which links back tothe main free storehouse of documentation.
That documentation must also be decentralized to prevent anyauthority from destroying the information.
This imperative really affects the way that progressmoves along.
A working wire coil is not enough.
It mustbe well characterized and documented with a series ofeasily accessible physics experiments.
There must beboth video and written content showing how to put ittogether.
These experiments lead to a very fractal levelof digression, but in the end they lead to absurdly robust technology which can be recreated from scratch byanyone anywhere quickly.
Free Everything!What is free energy? Usually this term is used by various conspiracy enthusiasts to describe ways of “gettingenergy for free” from something like the zero point quantum energy or the Earth’s magnetic field.
Both of theseare nonsense, as are all the free energy schemes presentedthroughout youtube and the rest of the Internet.
No, we are told, energy is not “free”.
It has to comefrom somewhere.
But this notion is based on a capitalistworld view.
Energy is free if you don’t have to get it froma mine and labor.
Most modern renewable energy is not36 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYfree: much labor is expended to build the infrastructureout of mined minerals which have a finite lifetime andeventually go to landfill to be replaced by more miningand labor.
But if free energy is energy that can be useful butis not derived from mining and labor, then free energycan and does exist.
Energy not spent on air conditioningwhen you build under a shade tree is free energy.
Energyfrom the sun that warms through your front window isfree energy.
And the electrical energy stored in salvagedrebuildable capacitors from salvaged rebuildable robotsstoring ambient energy is free.
Capitalist logic always looks for ways to show thatthings are not really free, because capitalism is based onthe ideas that value comes from labor and mined minerals.
If we approach industrial development from a perspective outside of that, however, we seek to build technology which is truly free, where no mineral extractionis implied in its construction.
A technology is free when it gives more than it takes.
For instance a robot might require a few hours of service from human labor once a year.
But if it does theequivalent of even just a few hundred hours of humanlabor it has a net negative cost in laborvalue.
In termsof minerals if it is built from minerals that were pollutingthe world around us, the mineral cost is negative: as opposed to subtracting value from the land as mining doesit adds value to the land.
And finally the energy of the37technology must be free in the sense that it absorbs fromsomething unwanted elsewhere.
Ultimately what is being built here is a form of artificial life.
Life takes only what can be given from somewhere else.
Our technology exists in a world where humanity is God.
This all goes back to the notion that thestructure of our technology is based on the monotheismof its initial architects.
We have built a technologicalworld where Man is God and only God is above Man(touse biblical sounding gibberish).
But this technology will be alive, will exist as animalsand plants do, without a singular separate God.
Thismeans that while it needs humanity to help it survive atall stages and can easily be controlled by humanity, itwill exist on its own and can function to a large extenton its own, following it’s hardwareprogammed logic tofind what it needs in the environment to keep living andcarrying out its mission.
Free technology is owned by no one.
Not only is thereno intellectual property, there is no physical property, except for the Trash Wizard stick, which might effectivelybe a part of a Trash Wizards person.
The act of creationof an free artifact is a gift to society of that artifact.
A trash wizard might grab any technology lying aroundand repurpose it at any time.
Free technology does notrecognize the concept of assigning value to things numerically in any way.
Free technology may get involved invarious value structures, having various types of abstract38 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYrelationships with various value structures, as codified inthe Tale and Lore(see later chapters on this).
Free technology is also energy free in the sense that it always usesambient energy, be it a set of pedals, a hand crank, a windturbine, a steam turbine, a tidal generator, a lightningaccumulator, or a solar concentrator.
Free technology isdesigned to be as modular as possible, being as friendlywith other unrelated technology as possible.
Free technology does not distinguish between information, energy, and materials–all three are processed asequal participants in the various flow through the system.
Technology is not to be considered free unless itcan be constructed by a small band of Trash Wizards using their Trash Wizard sticks along with common sourcematerials from the waste stream of the old extractionisteconomy.
The ideology of trash wizardry is that capitalist industry sacrificed itself for the bounty of our newfree world.
Mining is dangerous and destructive and suicidal, but it’s done, and we thank our ancestors, thanktheir sacrifice and their hard work and the creation ofso much material wealth so evenly distributed(you canfind a mineral from anywhere pretty much everywherethanks to the spread of capitalist industrial technology).
We give thanks for this great gift from our ancestors andbuild a society based on free living on the bones of theold world.
We accept that things will never go back tohow they were before industrial capitalism but that wecan live better because of our mineral inheritance.
We39accept that the ways of the old world were a suicide pact,but also that even in a more free world, we can never befree from change and uncertainty.
Ways of life, empires,whole worlds, climates, continents, will rise and fall, andwe cannot stop that level of cataclysmic change from happening.
But we can build an adaptable and sustainablefuture based on free values that moves forward into a future actually worth seeing.
We can bring adventure backinto the human condition, as well as acceptance of a hugeand uncertain world, and our role as passengers on it.
Free technology also breaks barriers between customer,worker, engineer.
We eliminate these hierarchical notions.
We are people.
We build things as needed andhelp each other as needed.
We tell stories to express ourvalues with the help of our Data Feed.
We break the veryidea of an economy open and build a new way of relatingto each other and existing.
A Technological Complete SetFundamentally, as every capitalist will explain, the economy is about making it easier for people to trade differentkinds of things.
And it is of course assumed that you needthings from someone you don’t know who wants to trademoney for stuff you “need”(even if that need is artificial,based on those people controlling all the communicationstechnology on the planet).
40 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYSo the way to destroy that is with technological Complete Sets.
A technological Complete Set is a set of technological methods and tools which allows the users tolive without contact with the centralized global economy.
That means they already have everything they need withthat core technology plus some work that is not too arduous for them to do(less arduous than engaging in theoutside economy).
A complete technological set has the following needsmet:• food• clean water• disposal of human waste• temperature control inside sheltered areas: heatand cooling of air in indoor environment of somekind, construction of those shelters such that thisneeds minimal• energy(use natural heat and coolness from the environment)• communication/networking/controls/ automation/audio/video/VR/AR these are the real reasons we need“computers”• medicine and drugs• make any of the tools needed for the rest of this,and do what industry might be needed to adapt41to changing conditions: more people, fewer people,newThat’s enough.
The rest comes from that.
And thisis very difficult to build and encompasses a lot of things.
Food is the one people always gravitate towards first,but I think that’s a mistake.
Just growing your ownfood does not give independence, especially if that foodis tied to land that is part of the ownership system.
To betruly free you have to be able to get food fast anywherewith gathering, hunting, and rapid and dense agriculture.
My guess is that a new agricultural technology willbe needed that integrates the rest of the complete setwith food and drug production, since it will all be partof the fractal reactor system(see later chapters), movingnutrients around as needed to grow both food and alsoother things that can be grown like drugs and even carbon nanostructures.
So when I put food on this list, I’mnot thinking of farms I’m thinking of a huge range of options.
For societies that have chosen to live in water, I’mimagining 24/7 aquaculture driven by high intensity growlights made from organic LEDs which are driven by tidalenergy, combined with reactors that get needed nutrientsfrom the sea while removing salt.
For deep sea dwellers,the main energy source will be violent wave action andwind, which can power floating worlds of aquaculture inthe same way.
42 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYI propose that the problems that need to be solvedfor food independence will be solved as a side effect if wefocus on medicine first.
This is one of the ways the capitalists use of controlling us.
And they know it.
“Sure”,the capitalists say, “go live in your hippie tree commune.
But when you need an MRI and some antibiotics or AIDSdrugs, you’ll have to come to us and if you don’t havefederal reserve debt currency to pay for it we’ll let youdie.
”As applied physicists(or Trash Magicians) it is ourjob to build the tools that let people practice medicine.
That means chemical testing and processing, growingof all types of microbe and plant needed for medicinein house with short lead times, noninvasive imaging,surgery, prosthetics, and a lot of other measurement tools,as well as the ability to quickly and accurately access thesum total of human medical knowledge.
The last partwill require a complete reorganization of how medicalknowledge works, and elimination of the arbitrary linesbetween doctor, nurse, pharmacist, patient, technician,and all the rest.
That is a hard problem, but it has to besolved to destroy capitalism, because we need medicineto live good lives and the capitalists have one of the mostvile monopolies on that.
So we need a chemical reactor that can work withmicrobes as well as chemicals, but this also covers a lotof other useful things! It’s how we get clean water andturn human waste into useful products, including food,43covering several of the points above.
It’s also how a lotof manufacturing will happen, because a closed environment of tubes and chambers and pumps is such a goodplace for assembler robots to function.
And what about cooling? We need refrigeration for alot of things, including food and medical storage, as wellas cooling to make spaces not too hot to live in.
Thatmeans pumps, and fluids.
If you can pump and movefluids around you can cool, with any of various workingfluids, including water and some readily available otherchemicals like ammonia.
Making ammonia from urineand then using compressors to make coolers out of thatseems like a good choice for a universal basic cooling unit.
Heat should really be from the clever use of solar(asin heat, not some photovoltaics, which I oppose in theircurrent form) as much as possible.
And cooling of humanhabitat should be the clever use of cool deep water andcool deep earth as much as possible.
The heat is thereand the coolness is there, we just need to think the heatflows through a bit more.
And with private propertyfetishism eliminated, and the world’s nationstates finallysmashed, migration can be a huge part of this.
It is asimple fact of life that some places are much nicer onetime of year than another.
One of the great crimes ofthe nationstate is forcing humanity to pretend this isn’ttrue.
Migration to a different climate on the time scale ofa season is not hard technologically, it’s all politics thatstops it.
No borders! No nations! No property!44 CHAPTER 2.
FREE TECHNOLOGYSo now the list above needs to get rearranged into alist of things to actually build.
Pumps, motors, generators, energy storage electrolytic cells, energy storage inpumped water, construction of all sizes of tubes, all thisforms the matrix the rest is built in.
And I need thegeneric assembler/editor technology mentioned before,where manipulators can cut and weld from the nanoscaleup through the meter scale the found objects thrownaway by capitalist society.
That should form the seed.
If it’s easy to do a chemistry process, build a good environment for a biologicalprocess, and reverse engineer and edit arbitrary semiconductor circuits, people with expertise on these things willbe able to quickly replicate the capitalist technology theyuse now.
Most “professionals” are being hurt by capitalism now, and using bad tools that make it hard to dotheir jobs.
Given the alternative of free and also better technology they’ll move over in droves and drive thisthing really fast, we just need to light the spark, makethat first set of tools, and lay down the design rules thatmake this progress work well while continuing to avoidcapitalism.
Part of how this needs to work is we needtools that people can adopt quickly.
A trained doctorshould be able to use our medical tools immediately because their function is obvious, simple, and easy to modify as needed by a person competent in their trade butwith zero background in our specific technology.
We seekto remove the technician and engineer completely from45the process of technology usage.
Destroy the EconomyUltimately this is a path to destroying the economy as itstands today.
The best people will jump ship the instantthey see that we have a better offer than the capitalists.
The capitalists rely on the exploitation of the professionalclass(with lots of perks thrown in to differentiate themfrom the working poor) for their system to work.
Givena choice, if people switch instantly to our methods, theirsystem of fear will crumble.
They will keep paying peopleto do work, but the wages will have to spiral upwards asthe best people refuse to work for money.
Eventuallythe working class can actually bankrupt the capitalistsby removing their labor from the money system.
If thelast capitalist wants to pay the last professional a trilliondollars a year to sell themselves stuff, so be it.
Withoutthe labor of the masses, they’re just another LARP club,and harmless.

1: second ContemplationSecond Contemplation: TetrahedralFractalSit and look at a free fractal thing in nature while youcolor this in.
This is symbolizing the fractal nature oftruly free things.
Trees and shrubs are all free.
Contemplate their fractal nature and their ability to build thismassive structure from the tiny whips of passing carbon47dioxide from the air over many years.
Incredible! Thetetrahedral fractal geometry shown in 3d here symbolizesthe union of our human geometry with that of nature.
In this case we flop around on the ground in a morepeaceful way, more slowly, at tai chi speeds even, to try toincorporate the slow pace of the tree into our thoughts.
Chapter 3PrinciplesStatement of Principles• All technology should be free• All people should be free to leave a technical sphereand enter or build another one• All national borders are not legitimate and must beabolished• The world is magical.
The properties we have always called “magic” can be ascribed to all thingsin the physical world, and these powers can be harnessed by the techniques of Trash Magic• Capitalism cannot and should not be reformed, itshould be opposed in all places and times until itdies• The concept of professionalism is harmful to the4849human condition, it poisons the soul, and is evil• The concept of finite number to represent humanvalues is a mind virus that must be purged.
The infinite exposes deeper truths than the finite.
Theseproblems go to the deepest level of our mathematical thought from arithmetic to the underlying axioms of mathematics• Morality consists of a set of axioms.
An axiom isa unproven statement which we take to be true inorder to build up a system of thought which canguide action.
The principles in this list are putforth as axioms.
• It is not our role to debate capitalism with its defenders.
Every possible basic argument for or againstcapitalism already exists on the Internet.
Our jobis to build a set of moral axioms, a set of technical skills and knowledge and build up a practicalsociety from that.
It is not our job to waste timerepeating the same arguments with capitalist apologists and time wasters.
• No technology should be made from massminedmaterials• The sum total of all money that exists in the worldis a small fraction of what would be needed to compensate the victims of capitalism from its crimes(e.
g.
slavery and imperialism), thus there can be no justicewithin that system50 CHAPTER 3.
PRINCIPLES• Every single word said every single idea ever putforth by an economist is a vicious lie.
Economics isnot a science, and this work is rejecting traditionalscience anyway.
It is not our job to argue with theeconomist it is our job to build a better world inwhich they are not welcome.
• The wage system must be abolished• End work.
I am against work in all forms.
We mustattack the concept of work at all levels.
• Technology is personal, as it should be.
Relationships between technology and the human body arealways in mind.
Design RulesEngineers who build technology usually use somethingcalled “design rules” and “figures of merit” as guides forhow to build a thing.
The following are the differentdesign rules in which we may deviate from capitalism toend up with technically different results:1.
The more general solution is always better2.
The Most readily available materials are always thefirst choice to use as well as to study3.
The most obvious solution is the best, althoughwhat is obvious may not be obvious4.
Self similarity is a desirable property, and by default it will be built in for several(but not infinite!)51zoom factors to all technical systems5.
All technology is art, all art is technology6.
All technology contains its own data, is linked toitself on the web, self documents how to make more,where it came from, where it is going7.
Technology is not really deployed until you can create it with zero federal reserve debt or consumptionof mined or extracted material.
To deploy a technology is simply to make it and have it get used,and you must spend zero money to make that happen.
Selling it after that is optional, and can bedone for workers to get central bank debt currencybut can also not be, and all parts can float in andout of different value circles(more on this later inthis work)8.
Absolute precision will scale linearly with scale,meaning that we might keep just 10% relative precision at different scales, with gross motion at 1meter with a few cm uncertainty, then a few cmmotion with a few mm precision, on down to 1 nmmotion with 1 angstrom precision.
9.
Every piece of technology should be as versatile aspossible, with clear and easy instructions encodedin it for many uses10.
We will not build or work with those who buildantipersonnel weapons.
Drones and other machinesare fair game as targets, however52 CHAPTER 3.
PRINCIPLES11.
Every technological component should have the maximum possible number of uses, and should be crossreferenced with other instances of itself so that theuser can find out those other uses instantly, andthis should be true of all the subcomponents of atechnical artifact12.
Every technological artifact and component shouldtell a personal story, connected to users, builders,and artists.

Chapter 4What is Trash Magic?Why Trash?Who owns a dog turd left on the street? Who ownsthe piles of plastic bottles that collect in an eddy of anurban stream? Who owns the soot that collects on thewalls of a bus stop? No one.
The concept of privateproperty, which I regard as evil, does not incorporate allthings.
For capitalism to function it has to have both“assets” and “liabilities”, which the capitalists associatewith opposite signs of numbers.
What if a turd is not aliability or an asset? It does not exist in the capitalistuniverse, it is their ultimate trash, of value to no one,and it is the seed that we must use to create a betterworld.
5455Why Magic?Many reasons.
First of all, what exactly is magic? It’ssubjective.
Magic is what, subjectively, gives us a certainfeeling of wonder about the world.
I believe that thatwonder should be intrinsic to our technology always, justas we expect it to be with art.
Hence the removal of theartificial separation between art and technology is a pathto what is essentially a form of magic.
Also, the use of this word is very annoying to members of the technocratic priesthood which this work seeksto undermine.
The very possibility that someone mightdo something useful and interesting in a sphere calledmagical is upsetting to them, because it is clearly notpart of their “pure”, “rational” world.
This thus drawsa line in the sand of sorts: on one side is engineering andbusiness and the rest of the “rational world”, and ourwork stands very much on the other side, where thingsare a little less sharp and clear and countable.
Hence mystatements in the first chapter about Trash Magic beingan artistic movement in this first stage.
What is a Trash Witch? What is aTrash Wizard?Witches and Wizards have for centuries been symbols ofhumans’ ability to wield various magic powers.
I draw onmany traditions for this concept, from pagan lore through56 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?Tolkien and Harry Potter.
The traditions built up fromfiction, culture, and religions of various kinds give us apicture to draw on for the archetype of the Trash Magician.
I don’t want to use the term “magician” toomuch though because it can be mistaken for the person who puts on a magic show.
Perhaps that is not allbad, though! The magic show can both teach and inspirewonder and that is certainly one goal of Trash Magic.
A potential downside of calling us all witches and wizards is that those can be gendered terms, and that’s notwhat I’m looking for with this new society.
But I willpropose for the sake of this work a non gendered definition of witch and wizard.
The person wielding trashmagic at any time is practicing witchery or wizardry ifthey are doing witch like magic or wizard like magic.
For example, let’s say you’re in the woods at night,doing some hard core potion making and saying something like “fair is foul and foul is fair”, and there’s a lotof cackling.
That’s witchery.
If you’re in a huge fieldof rocks swinging your Trash Staff around and launching lighting bolts at the other rocks, that’s wizardry.
It doesn’t matter what gender the practitioner may ormay not have–if you are wizarding you’re a wizard, ifyou’re witching you’re a witch.
At least for the moment.
Mostly trash magicians have both Trash Wizardand Trash Witch natures, and most magics we practicewill use both as well.
But I have still only loosely defined this way of being.
57The Trash Witch is someone who believes in a worldwhere we both have a element of adventure and mysteryin our lives and where we have the advantages of whatwe now call “modern technology”.
We believe that thismagic should be available freely to everyone in the world,and that everyone in the world should have the freedomto wield this and modify it as they see fit, and use or notuse whatever magic they need or don’t need.
Trash Wizards and Trash Witches use the laws ofphysics and the methods of applied physics as a formof magic.
We teach that magic to others, and spreadboth the serious scholarship of Trash Magic and the basicpractical skills needed to give the magic to all.
All our teaching and building is free.
Free, meaningoutside the money system and capitalist economy.
Butalso free meaning people have total freedom to take thisand duplicate it and modify it and make it truly theirown.
A love of pure science demonstrations is a corevalue of the Trash Wizard or Witch.
Another goal is independence.
A group of just TrashWitches should for example be able to live on their own,with a good quality of life.
Maybe dozens of Wizardsor dozens of Witches can easily form tribes to build andscavenge and do adventures and art.
But also tribes canform supertribes which merge to build truly large works.
The only way giant social structures can be optional andnot control us all is for us to be able to live freely withjust a few people.
The magic we plan to wield here is58 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?designed to give people that power.
Figure 4.
1: Wizard by the creekWe also strive to amuse.
You don’t want to learnabout magnetic fields just because they’re useful.
You59can see from us that they’re actually magical! Magicalenough that a show put on with magnetic fields or electricfields is very much worth watching.
In fact, one of themost popular shows in most science museums is the electric field demonstrations with giant lighting machines.
So a Trash Magician uses a combination of Wizardryand Witchery to amuse and provide for people with Trashof the world.
Trash is generally stuff that is not only freebut infinitely free.
Not only can you go find one or twoor 10,000 of a thing, you know that later you can go backand do that again as many times as you want.
This istrue with flowing water from spring snow runoff or fromtides or drainage of some large rainy area.
It’s true ofwinds that always blow, of the sun, of sand and dirt androcks.
It’s true of sticks shed by the lower sections of pinetrees.
And it’s true of the plastic bottles thrown away bycapitalist society.
A society of free stuff is not one with “zero cost”.
It’sone where cost is infinite but value is also infinite.
Weare moving to a value system that works mostly with infinities.
That is part of what makes Trash Magic actuallymagical.
And if you’re a Trash Witch or Wizard, that’syour stuff! You wield the magic that moves the trasharound!In addition to Trash Wizardry and Witchery one mightbe a Trash Daemon or Trash Imp.
Trash Goblins canhave a place in our community but not Trolls.
Trash Wizards are always there for everyone.
We wel60 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?come the refugees of capitalism and it’s evil twin, war.
We do not recognize the validity of borders and are hereto help subvert them as needed to help the down trodden.
Alchemy, Chemistry and ArtPart of the narrative we learn when we study chemistryin school is the failure of alchemy to accurately describethe elements.
We learn that these primitive prechemiststhought of the elements as being earth, air, fire and water,rather than the array of chemical elements we know intoday’s periodic table.
The real elements are divided upbased on our supposedly superior modern understandingthat atoms are the basis of all matter.
I dispute none of basic science we all learned in schoolin terms of atomic structure, this manifesto is not quitethat kooky.
What I do dispute is how information is organized in our minds and in our education system.
Consideran element like oxygen.
We know that a lot of oxygenin the world around us is in the form of two atoms together, as a gas which makes up about one fifth of the airaround us.
We also know that all water has one oxygenatom(along with two hydrogens), and so all the water inour world has oxygen.
Fire is pretty much always a rapidchemical reaction involving oxygen, so we also know thatall the flames we see in our world on Earth are partlymade from a form of oxygen.
Finally, the one of themost common minerals on our planet is the relatively in61ert silicon dioxide that makes up most sand as well asmany other minerals.
The melting point of this solid iswell over one thousand degrees.
Now, while I would never deny that it’s useful to sayall these things have oxygen, or to understand what thatmeans, is that really the most pertinent quality they allhave? To the alchemist sand is “earth”, fire is fire, wateris water, and air is air.
Four elements, which we deal withvery differently in all possible ways.
We look at that andsay it’s “wrong” because the knowledge of what atomsmake up these things is somehow more “fundamental”supposedly.
But what if we didn’t organize things thatway, even though we understand how atoms work? Whatif we still recognized that earth, air, water, and fire aselements, which just happen to be also made up of atoms?This world view would have the same facts as the one wehold today, just with their order rearranged.
Ideally what I seek from this project is to removethese kinds of hierarchies altogether.
I don’t want to saythat alchemy is “right” and chemistry is “wrong”, whatI object to is the basic notion of right and wrong here.
It’s based on the notion of our ideas having some kind ofobjective other reality beyond that of the world we livein.
I think this kind of ordering of ideas is one of the wayswe’ve held ourselves back in science due to ideology.
We need to stop banishing things like spells and elementals and potions from “real” science just becauseof cultural values.
A drug is a magic potion, what else62 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?would it be? Prove it isn’t! A program on the firmwareof a robot is a magic spell.
Prove it isn’t! And everyartist knows art is magic.
The only way we have deniedthat in science is by simply saying we’re better than arton the ladder of “reality”.
This has, again, held us allback.
It’s led to a century of inaccessible art and incomprehensible science.
We need to reunite the strands ofalchemy, magic, art, and science.
SymbologyWhere do trash magic artists get our symbols? From thenatural world, from geometry, from anarchist iconography, and from religious art.
We also seek to replicate,but softened by the influence of the natural world, thedesign aesthetics of 20th century industry.
This will bealmost a parody or a three dimensional rhyme of sorts,not so much to bring out the function of the industrialthing but to remind us of its form to make us think ofwhere our trash comes from and what we are replacing.
Note that when I say religious art, this is very broad,since much of art through the ages has always been inspired by whatever the artist viewed religion to mean.
Religion is our deepest held set of beliefs which form ourworld view outside of that which can be proven.
Art atits best tries to express what that means, and is oftendeeply religious, but takes very different forms due tothe diversity of religious beliefs.
In particular, however,63trash magic will lean toward the “occult” from variousWestern traditions.
Due to the author’s nonindigenousWestern background, I want to avoid appropriating cultural traditions of which I’m not a part.
And I feel likeone way to do this is to focus on “pagan” traditions ofvarious kinds, as well as occult Jewish and Christian art.
The anarchist symbology will include the black wildcat used by the IWW and other anarchists, as well asvarious permutations of the circle A.
The following imagecombines the black cat with the form of the magnetic fieldfrom a tiny magnet, symbolizing one of the forces whichwe will harness in Trash Magic.
Some electrical symbols will also be incorporated, partlysince many things we will make involve building electricalcircuits, and building those symbols into the art makesthings selfdocumenting.
While these form a useful function in helping to make a thing free by documenting howit’s put together, they should never abandon form forfunction: circuit documentation should be a work of artas much as a document(for a counter example showingsome of the most hideously ugly graphical communication ever invented see any computerbased electronics design software ever).
64 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?Figure 4.
2: Wildcat in the fieldCapitalisms Unwanted: a HumanTreasureOne of the sources of constant pain for most people subject to global capitalism is the phenomenon of some humans being simply unwanted by capitalism.
The peoplewho live in the big cities and write computer code for aliving and control the nodes of power in our society nolonger have use for most of humanity.
This is true evenin a supposedly “rich” country like the United States or65Figure 4.
3: The four elements of Alchemy and the addedelement of ions(sphere)France.
Looked at globally, whole nations are written offby the global elite as disposable, a mere nuisance.
Meanwhile, war, an inevitable aspect of capitalism, creates anendless stream of people who have had even what littleshreds of social wealth they might have had smashed bythe war machines of Capital.
Environmental destructionwill also create increasing numbers of refugees as population grows and our living world continues to be murderedby Capitalists.
66 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?Figure 4.
4: Universal symbol of a squatThe people in this “unwanted” demographic have nothing to gain from the current system.
Most of the laws inour system exist to protect property owners from thosewho do not have property.
As long as someone ownsproperty, the capitalists care at least enough about themto tax them.
Once someone has no property and nospecial technical skills to put them in the priesthood of“tech” the capitalist system has zero use for them andthus doesn’t bother to help them even survive any more67than they have to as vestiges of the society the Reaganistshave destroyed in the last 40 years.
But from our standpoint the concept of a “lower class”simply makes no sense.
Each human mind has infinitepower to create art and science and culture.
The fact thatcapitalism has created an infinite stream of unwantedhumanity outside their system, who have zero vested interest in that system simply means there is an unlimited supply of human genius to deploy on post capitalistprojects.
The future belongs to those who are able towelcome capitalisms unwanted with open arms as the infinite treasure they are rather than constantly attemptingto cull out the “unwanted” from their own ranks, drivingthe working poor out of their cities or off their land.
We must develop technology/art/culture which naturally appeals to and is instantly useful to those abandoned by capitalism.
It’s the right thing to do, since theyare the most underserved in the current system.
But it’salso the long term strategic thing to do, since it meanswe will naturally out grow and overtake the capitalistsystem as we build something that is better enough thatmore and more strata of the existing society jump acrossto the free world and join us.
Skeletron: The Wooden Bones of ArtSkeletron is the system that makes the bones of TrashMagic artifacts.
Skeletron is simply a way to modify68 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?things found in your environment to make them playtogether well with Trash Magic.
Primarily this meansgathering sticks, shaving them to be flat on one or moresides and removing the bark, and drilling holes in them.
Quarter inch holes spaced about one inch along the line ofthe sticks is the most basic component of Skeletron.
Thiscan be used to do many things, and as more people buildit and use it and modify it, it will become increasinglyversatile and free.
Another way to build up Skeletron which may win inthe long run or may not is simply carving notches in eachend of all the sticks, and lashing them together with rope,with rocks tied to the ropes for weight to apply force tothe lashings.
This technique will be elaborated on nearthe end of this work.
With a universal wood framing system we can buildup many different human sized structures.
This can beused to make various shelters, although to do this we willadd plastics to the system, using methods of hand plasticwelding detailed in the last chapter of this volume.
Withthe ability to make wood skeletons with plastic skins wecan make waterproof structures on land as well as waterproof boat structures and amphibious artifacts of variouskinds.
The combination of wood and plastic in a modularand modifiable way also can be the basis of all the otherindustrial constructions to be described in this work.
69Trash Magic Kit: The StickeningPart of practicing Trash Magic is having constant accessto some basic technology kit, generally based on varioussticks from the above system, which can be used to buildup everything else.
What are some capabilities of Trash Magic kit?1.
Measuring tools: distance, position, mass, volume,temperature, pressure, etc.

3d imaging at all scales with vibration of fluids andion transportFree Phones in Trash MagicOne of the many idiotic things capitalists say to shut uptheir critics is to point out that capitalism is the sourceof the smart phones that anticapitalists inevitably use.
These devices are indeed amazing, and are no longer luxury items by any means.
On the contrary, they are verymuch a survival tool used by the oppressed classes now,and it’s very dangerous to ignore that role this technologyplays.
But what aspect of them is so great? The socialnetworking.
That’s always what you need: access to theweb, various messaging systems, and various commercialthings like Uber and Lyft.
Does that really need to be a computer? A truly freephone would be a pure communication tool that communicates in a distributed way like fido net of old.
thesole purpose of the hardware would be to communicateimages, sounds, text, and to decide where those shouldgo.
That’s it.
What the hell do you need a computerfor? Mostly so that The Man can spy on you and figureout how to sell you things you don’t need, and force youto constantly throw more federal reserve debt back intothe machine for more advanced machines to get moreindoctrination to continue the cycle.
71Don’t be fooled by the dominance of the computertechnology into believing that’s inevitable.
It’s not.
Wecan get orders of magnitude more benefit from peer topeer networks than we do today as slaves to the militaryindustrial machine if these phones were all free like freedom, linked up on free hardware all the way.
This canactually be the basic informational skeleton of the valuegeometries discussed later in this book.
I believe that the hardware can be reworked from theground up based on our approach to applied electromagnetism to get information technology with totally newfabrication methods.
But in the mean time, given thatthat is a lengthy applied physics research project, whatcan we do? My answer is to watch closely everything thathas anything to do with Raspberry Pi and other “internet of things” projects in the open hardware domain.
Isay “open hardware” here and not free hardware, because it’s not free according to my strict definition: itrelies on mine driven fab and capitalism, and there isIP in the supply chain(and some other problems).
Butit’s way better in terms of open and free than the wholeandroid/apple ecosystem.
The Tripod and MultitoolThe basis for all Trash Magic fabrication will be the tripod.
a tripod is exactly what it sounds like: three sticks,joined at the top with wire or tape or rope, as well as72 CHAPTER 4.
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?with guy wires at the bottom if needed, with the basesof the three sticks planted in the ground for stability.
Arock hangs from the center to keep it steady.
Each of the three sticks shall be of Skeletron.
Eachshall be the size of the Standard Trash Magic Staff.
Apractitioner of Trash Magic shall have the power to deploy this at any time, at any scale and with any tool.
Fullxyz motion is possible with wires that are fed throughholes or wheels on the sticks, and can go to stepper motors for drive and/or wheels on potentiometers.
Eachwire connects to an arduino that runs a three terminalpulsed transport measuring protocol.
The ADC signalsare amplified and converted with some math to an audiosignal, visual display, and or vibrotactile interface.
This probe can be heated with the wires, can do localelectrochemical work and measurement, measure nonlinearities of all kinds, and can thus weld, plate, edit, implant ions, plastic weld and plastic reshape, signals alsodisplayed in a GUI in a smart phone if needed but canalso not be, can have no “smart” computer at all, justdumb computers.
Sensing can be capacitive, inductive,resistive, frequency dependent or not, nonlinear or not,gated or not.
Many different sizes and weights can beused, gear ratios can be changed on the fly with variousinterchangeable wheels.
Everything is modular.
Thermal regulation of processes can be carried outby moving the position of a suspended cauldron in 3 dimensions relative to a fire at the bottom of the tripod,73using a microprocessor and feedback on a thermometerto regulate the temperature to a fixed point.
In a cluster of Trash Magic industrial production therecan be many tripods, all in a network, connected by plastic plumbing, electrical and data connections, and ziplines that move materials from one to another, settingup ad hoc nodes in an assembly line that can be grownand shrunk on the fly.
Tripods can also support roof and wall materials, making shelters that people can sleep and work in.
Tripodscan be trees that already exist.
Tripods can also be completely submerged for doing intricate work on the bottomof a body of water.
In zero gravity another set of sticksare needed, and another cable and springs.
The materials for a pair of tripods should also be able to becomethe skeleton of a simple boat, which can then deploy minitripods to the water below it.
Tripods can be fractal, with a small tripod loweredfrom the tool head of a large tripod.
Smallest tripodsshould have Angstrom resolution and atomically sharptips, biggest ones are hundreds of meters tall.
Note that this section is a work in very active progressand that tripod should really be generalized to “threedimensional geometry made from sticks and rocks andrope”.
This should become an entire field of artistic endeavor if this movement grows.

And MoreThis chapter is one that must be sparse in the first edition but which will expand in the future.
That is becauseI have a bit of a chicken and egg problem: I need a finished manifesto to inspire me into total commitment tothe applied physics research, but need the fruits of thatresearch to properly deploy this first edition manifesto.
So I’ll attempt to split the difference here, just sketchingout a crude shadow of the things I plan to build, with theunderstanding that it’s probably wildly inaccurate basedon how the research will create surprises.

Chapter 5UniversitiesThe university system is a disaster in just about everyway possible.
However the potential of this system istoo great to ignore.
The potential of all those excitedyoung people ready to change the world who also happen to be on some of the nicest land in the world, ininstitutions which have a fair amount of independencecan truly change the world if they change how they arerun.
Much of this chapter should not be written by mebut by the people who are scholars of the history ofstudent insurrections.
Student insurrection has been acritical component of both university life and revolutionary practice for many centuries.
There are whole movements dedicated to this kind of work, some of whichare documented in the Undercommons Project at http:7778 CHAPTER 5.
UNIVERSITIES//undercommoning.
org.
If you are on a university campus, study the links contained there and study universityhistory and the history of student revolt globally.
Studythis history and learn how to apply it to your own storyand your own campus.
Universities: Visions of UtopiaIf the university campus lived up to its potential it couldbe a true paradise: essentially a giant garden filled withbuildings for studying and creating knowledge.
Amazing!They are usually situated on some of the best land to befound anywhere, have great access to everything neededin life, and have dense urban style housing in a pastoralenvironment which allows for a simple, car free life.
University campuses are often physically spectacular.
They often have some of the greatest examples of artand architecture in their construction and are lovinglymaintained for in some cases hundreds of years.
It istypical for them to have wooded areas owned by the university, as well as often water and in many cases access tovery large bodies of water.
University campuses are oftenmore self contained than most institutions, creating theirown power and managing their own utilities, and havinga fair amount of autonomy from local government.
79Undergraduate Education: BrokenPromisesThe college education has become a key element in thegreat lie of the American middle class dream.
It is alsoa major factor in the older generation destroying the opportunities they had for the younger generation.
College has become just another capitalist cartel, exploiting the hopes of young people in exchange for a lifeof debt servitude.
Young people are still told by their elders that a college education is needed to enter the middleclass, which is supposed to be a good thing.
They’re toldthat the price is justified by long term earnings.
Thenthey’re sent off to live in a party resort for 5 years wherethey shuffle through a series of pointless and irrelevantclasses, and wind up with a bill of many tens of thousandsof dollars(this is primarily an American problem, but theneoliberals will bring it to your country soon enough ifthey’re not crushed at the global level).
And what do we learn there? Theory! Propaganda!How to write papers no one will read about stuff no onecares about.
100 year old science.
At this point defendersof the System start howling about “pure knowledge”, bywhich they mean theory over “applied knowledge”, bywhich they mean actual knowledge about how the worldworks.
Theory is a virus, a disease, and a religion, andit has no place here.
What should we learn? The same subjects, but taught80 CHAPTER 5.
UNIVERSITIESusefully.
Why can’t biology majors make drugs? Whycan’t physics majors build a solar powered soaring drone?Why can’t chemistry majors build a water desalinationplant? Many subjects should, I think, be totally eliminated, as they have no real value, such as economics andcomputer “science”.
Science Grad School: The Ponzi SchemeYou don’t have to go to graduate school to see how muchit resembles a pyramid scam.
Suppose any one professorhas about five graduate students at a time, each of whomtakes about five years to graduate with a PhD.
If a professor does this for 30 years, they will create on averageone PhD per year or 30 PhD’s total.
Now suppose allthose PhD’s find jobs similar to what their advisor has.
This is possible only if the size of the field increases by30 times in 30 years.
Very crudely this corresponds toabout 12% per year.
Given the expansion of the physical sciences and their satellites in the years during anddirectly after World War II, building a scheme like thisin those years actually made some sense.
However, thosedays are decades behind us, and now as research budgetsshrink and schools, companies, and government agenciesare systematically destroyed by politics, this math looksmuch more like a pyramid scam than a response to society’s needs.
81As a grad student you will probably never get thejob you’re supposedly being trained for.
But you willdedicate 57 years of your life to helping someone whodid get that job to continue to climb the academic ladder.
The people at the bottom of the academic pyramid spendtheir lives working to help the people at the top, and thenare mostly cast aside.
The tenure clock then puts yet another opportunityfor exploitation in the career path, making yet anotherway for people now well into middle age to work longhours for more years to build up an academy that theymight then be cast out of.
Hollowing Out of the AcademyThere are many factors that have contributed to thedownfall of the university system over the last few years.
I would argue that since Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States in 1980 there has been a coordinated ideological war against all culture that mightexist outside of the profit system, and that universitieshave felt the brunt of this particularly hard.
A robust, healthy, independent, and publicly supported university system could provide a real balanceagainst mainstream corporate power if it existed.
It istherefore strategically important for the lords of globalcorporate rule that they be as controlled as possible by82 CHAPTER 5.
UNIVERSITIEScorporations and the central government so that theycannot exercise a check on those forms of power.
Intellectual PropertyIntellectual property deserves its own section here because it has been so corrosive to the culture of the academyin so many ways.
This manifesto is opposed to all formsof private property, and particularly intellectual property, but the patenting and copyrighting of work done inuniversities is particularly evil.
It is now standard practice for public tax money tobe spent to create knowledge which then goes into papersbehind a paywall protected by brutal copyright enforcement and into patented or even trade secret knowledge.
If the rule of law actually meant anything this wouldclearly constitute a criminal theft from the public.
Thefact that this is not considered a criminal act is in facta major indication of the evil nature of the capitalists’socalled “rule of law”.
Potential ParadisesHow should a university work, after the fall of capitalismand the takeover of their administration? They must beselfsufficient.
They must grow all their own food andproduce all their own energy and industrial goods.
Theymust be able to maintain the core knowledge contained83in the libraries with equal or superior care to the existingcapitalist system, as that is the heart of the university.
The education of the incoming young people who arenow called “undergraduates” must be joined with theconstruction of this new world.
That is, undergraduateswill combine learning with labor to actually physicallygrow the food, build the robots, build the industrial production, build the energy infrastructure etc.
The graduate education will combine more advanced and specialized practical work with more scholarship: writing andreading as it has been done by scholars for thousands ofyears.
What are now called “staff” must be integratedinto this as well, both on the scholarship and on the workand the development of new methods of work.
Bringingthe staff into your insurrection early also creates powerfulallies for later on as you fully take over the school.
University Occupations, Phase 2Any history of any radical movement will inevitably involve student occupations.
Students typically take oversome space on campus, keep the land from the cops, andcarry out various protest actions or teach ins over somenumber of days or maybe weeks.
In some cases theystand down after actually getting some demands met bythe administration.
And then they end, and everyonemoves on.
84 CHAPTER 5.
UNIVERSITIESI suggest that as with all occupations one way theycan continue is to create art that can be moved and lastsand is taken from one action to another, creating a wholenarrative that passes along both the ideas and productsof each action to the next, creating a snowball effect.
Thepurpose of this chapter is to gently nudge people in thedirection of building this kind of infrastructure insteadof just running a protest as long as possible until theinevitable crackdown.
Case Study: Your SchoolYou have to write this section and integrate it into yourversion of the text, if you are connected with a university.
How much land does the school own? Map that, andgo walk the land and figure out what is on it and how itflows.
What energy resources are connected to that land?A creek or river or ocean is your first choice.
In manycases the local river is near but not directly adjoiningthe campus.
Figure out what a supply chain would looklike that would connect infrastructure you build betweenthe cracks of the property society on that river with thecampus.
Can you charge batteries in large numbers andbring them to campus using couriers? Can you buildhidden power lines to bring power in? What about water,can you purify that, bottle it, and bring it in by courier?Study the map you make of your campus and environs,and figure out what it would look like to get supply chains85Figure 5.

A location of many famousinsurrectionsbuilt up that will function under martial law, in all outwar with the campus police.
Do not just plan for the short term! If you play chesswith the campus police you will lose; you want to play go.
In go, territory is captured and lost in a dynamic way,and those gains and losses can oscillate forever in theory.
You want to build long term strategy that involves notjust holding an administration building for as long aspossible, but to become a force that flows around campus,rising and falling as you see opportunities, and fading86 CHAPTER 5.

87away.
University insurrections have always suffered froma lack of strategic thought in terms of how land is takenand held.
Realize that as soon as you create any sort ofresistance fixed in geography you are handing advantageto the campus authorities.
You are fighting a guerrillawar, act accordingly.
Also, the long term plan must be partly legal in nature, to exist within the capitalist state without furthermilitary escalation by authorities.
This means you needto recruit from the law school, and have people studyingthe corporate governance of your school specifically tofigure out how to carry out a legal coup d’etat in whichfull legal control of the university corporation is won bythe insurrectionists.
University corporate charters can bevery complex and strange and old.
Legal documents likethis often have strange legal loopholes which are hard tofind but which can be exploited at the right moment insuch a way that those who believe in the socalled “ruleof law” can be convinced to side with the insurrection.
Note that this “war” should never be about violence.
While the goals are similar to violent insurrections for amore democratic and free campus, the methods shouldnever involve competing in violence with those who havemade it their life’s work(the campus police and theirbackers).
Rather, we must win on superior infrastructure.
Build better things: better technology, better classes,better scholarship, better classrooms, better food, betterhousing, better libraries.
Do that and you can really win88 CHAPTER 5.
UNIVERSITIESthe academy back for the scholars away from the businessscam artists who now run all universities.
Universities: a Global BeachheadTaking universities over can be a huge international beachhead that goes around all national borders.
Every country has them.
And they all have very energetic youngpeople who want to change the world and try new things.
They can be of huge global importance in the years tocome as the current system falls apart.
Capitalism iskilling the universities, and the faculty who love the schoolswill see eventually that they have to abandon capitalismif they are to see what is good in the system continuepast this century.

What could you build here?Chapter 6Rumbles of RobotsRobots!Robots! The word is loaded with both promise and peril.
We dream of robots that do all tedious labor, freeinghumanity from it, as well as of robots that might takeover and kill us all(fiction seems to favor the latter).
I also believe robots can be transformative, althoughI think we should look at much of the hype from today’s“tech” companies with many grains of salt.
Self drivingcars and autonomous battle robots have mostly turnedout to be worthless hype machines useful for making Silicon Valley hucksters rich and not for much else.
Here I will look at some of the robots I think weshould build with Trash Magic which can make a betterworld for caring for one another and having adventures,9091which is what this book is all about.
A Rumble of RobotsThe collective noun for robots is “a rumble of robots.
”I’m not sure where I heard this, I think one of my friendsmay have made it up, but it’s so perfect it’s too goodnot to use.
So I want to talk about rumbles of robots.
In particular the difference between robots used for consumption and for production.
Amazon is in the process of building robot based infrastructure for delivery.
This is fundamentally a consumptiondriven project.
The main initial figure of merit in thegrowth of their network will be coverage: the more potential consumers are covered, the better.
This will meanthat it is optimal for robots to be as far as possible fromother robots.
But how does this picture change for production?Rumbles of robots are very common on the production side of things.
Those who produce cars and computers and the like often have rumbles of robots, withhumans just as technicians who run the machines.
Muchlike a cow hand or shepherd, I think there should be aname for those who herd rumbles of robots: rumbler.
Sothe trash wizard is also a rumbler.
And the trash wizardstick is like the shepherd’s crook: a device that controlsa network that consists of your rumble of robots.
92 CHAPTER 6.
RUMBLES OF ROBOTSThat is what seizing the means of production is really all about.
It’s not about seizing an existing factory,which will be based on existing methods, or about building a primitive system that can’t compete.
It’s aboutbuilding rumbles of robots which can reproduce themselves by harvesting free materials to make more, andthen rumbling them around to build what else you need.
Key elements of the trash wizards’ robot rumble aremobility and versatility.
They will run off of locally harvested energy, and be programmed to gather energy asneeded as well as materials.
They should scale in thesense that the robots you need for a 10 bot rumble are notso different from a single roninbot or a 1000 bot rumble.
They should be able to reproduce from found materialsand forage for those materials with some simple guidancefrom the rumbler.
That is the plan.
Robots with different times scales,centuries of work, or hours of lifetimeSomething that I think needs to be investigated in robotdesign is time scale.
Capitalists like a certain time scale–the shorter the better.
But without capitalism and itsobsession with short term growth and profits we can havetime scales of hundreds of years or even longer in somecases.
Suppose an area of land is contaminated with plu93tonium or some other radioactive heavy metal.
It mightbe there for many thousands of years, making the landuninhabitable.
Thousands of years, but not forever, andplutonium has uses even in a peaceful society withoutrules.
Why not clean it up?Perhaps the robots that clean plutonium will growtheir own biofuel to get energy from the sun and slowlypick their way across the land, working with cyborg wormsand fungi to dig up the atoms and move them togetherand out of the water table.
How many processes of atomicor molecular transport open up when we allow a processto take thousands of years? Many.
I’m sure capitalistsalready use the term “geological engineering” but I wouldsay that to truly apply that term, you should be carryingout a technical/artistic endeavor which takes place on ageological time scale.
That means it has to be very easyfor future people to understand, maintain and repair.
Italso has to anticipate future geological changes, includingcatastrophic ones like a volcano that destroyed all life onearth for a billion years.
And it should have time horizons that stretch well into the 10’s of millions of years.
What’s your hurry! If we were not all hounded by debtto capitalists we could take time to really work on hardthings like plutonium cleanup one atom at a time.

RUMBLES OF ROBOTSEarth RobotsThe octahedral ball drone is a octahedron made of threeintersecting sticks, with a flexible joint.
Simple mechanical motions of the tips of the balllike shape cause it toroll across the landscape with a slight hopping or walkingaspect that makes it able to deal with very rough terrain.
Rolling ball robots can be used for all sorts of longslow land cleaning processes.
Rather than try to maximize battery life, they will use capacitors to store energy,and recharge the capacitors from ambient energy.
For arumble of jacks in the prairie, the obvious source of poweris the wind.
Ideally, the wind will be used to create energy which will immediately go into directed propulsion.
This might be slow since it depends on gusts, but it cango on forever, so slowness becomes ok.
This is technologythat you would deploy to spend 1000 years cleaning up asacrifice zone, where you want no outside energy or materials to be needed at all and for the rumble to keep doingits work for hundreds of years.
Also, obviously, clearingof mine fields is an immediate application.
A rumble oftiresized octahedra could potentially roll themselves at10’s of miles per hour, keeping up with a car or truckand making it possible for the rumble to proceed in amob ahead of a motor vehicle, taking out IED’s in realtime.
The rumble could end up in a convoy geometry,stretched out over the length of the road, doing reconahead and tracking behind to see what’s happening after95a convoy passes.
In these applications it probably makessense for the source of power to be the trucks or cars inthe human/freight convoy, with individuals in the rumblecycling through the charging station and back out intothe rumble.
These are a great tool for agriculture, or even justgathering.
A gathering rumble could go out and gatherroots and berries from the countryside in a quasicultivatedarea.
These roving balls could be picking up and dropping seeds as they go, mapping where all the useful plantsare, and also harvesting as they go, taking wind, sun andwater as energy sources as needed, then spending energywhen it’s available to do the work.
Rolling robots with windmills: they roll, then gatherwind electricity into a capacitor, roll again, and repeat.
They can go for hundreds of miles with no intervention.
The instinct to go a certain direction based on navigatingoff of the sun is programmed into the physical hardware.
After some long time, maybe many years, the machinecalls for help, eventually someone finds it and follows theinstructions for repair and improvement.
With generation after generation editing and helping the thing exist, it can exist for hundreds of years, slowly cleaning upwasted sacrifice zones of the old capitalist world.
Free robots like this are a rational response to thefact that the existing system has created sacrifice zones.
These sacrifice zones have negative economic value in theold system, making them freely available to be absorbed96 CHAPTER 6.
RUMBLES OF ROBOTSinto the free industrial infrastructure.
This is key: inorder to avoid getting crushed by the forces of the oldsystem too early our movement must exist in the fringesof the current system, where the old ways have createdland of negative value.
The very fact that land can havenegative value, that this is a concept that people accept,should be yet another red flag that assignment of numerical values to real human values is a morally bankruptact.
This should always be the goal of free technology if itwants to grow exponentially without a lot of resistance:the input must be things deemed of “negative value” bythe old system.
Unlike most projects in capitalism whichconstantly drain everyone involved more and more overtime, creating generation after generation of institutionalburnout.
Air RobotsEveryone is in such a hurry! Most aerial drones for personal use today(2016) are designed to move very fast forvery short periods of time.
Generally with four propellors pointed straight up, they can take off fast anywhere,go in all directions fast, dodge fast moving obstacles, andoften only last a few minutes.
If broken, they have numerous small parts which can be very hard to fix.
Quad copter personal drones are great capitalist technology: they break easily, cost a lot, do very little, need97constant upgrades, and are mostly “useful” for entertaining the technopriesthood and annoying everyone else.
Not surprisingly I see much that can be improved here.
The first way I would set about making drones lessuseless is by making them float instead of fly with propellors.
Given that they’re both small and don’t have livingcargo, I would say the arguments against hydrogen forlift are mostly obsolete.
How should motors work for soaring drones? First ofall, if the thing is large enough it can float on the circular current patterns in the upper atmosphere, holdingposition with no mechanical work done.
But what aboutmotors for guidance? These motors should be electrostatic, powered by extremely high voltage giant ballooncapacitors which are the main body of the soaring drone.
Using two very light polymers in very thin sheets withopposite positions on the turboelectric series, it shouldbe possible when far from the ground to generate extremely high voltages very easily using the mechanicalenergy source of the rotating air currents.
Electrostaticmotors can then run off these, also built from thin polymer sheets with thin metallization.
No magnets and nocopper coils! It’s nutty to use the magnetic field for highaltitude low power low speed motors, they should all bebased on electric fields, because it’s easy to get megavoltsup there.
What about scaling these robots way up in size andweight for use inside storms? One could imagine giant98 CHAPTER 6.
RUMBLES OF ROBOTSFigure 6.
1: Hydrogen Drone99metal gliders in massive rumbles of 10’s of thousandsor maybe even millions of units, all ripping around ina storm could over the ocean.
These then generate gianthydrogenfilled blimps which then gather in a huge rumble to go turn back into useful work near a settlement orfloating factory.
Water RobotsLittoral robot rumbles which can use tides and river currents to generate electricity to propel themselves upstreamshould be built.
They can be amphibious, use waterto charge and land to move, can move with hopping,jumping, walking, rolling, and slithering.
Littoral trashcleanup robots are fundable under capitalist government,can make a huge difference in cleanup of a waterway, andalso give us free source material for more building.
Another robot rumble I want to build is the slithering water robots.
These use the usual magnet and coilarrangement to create a slithering motion in buoyant objects, which can then smoothly cut through the water.
The fact that this has not been widely deployed is totally insane: the same drive can be used in reverse to getelectrical power out of wave action.
If the length of eachrobot is a few wavelengths, the whole thing will be forcedinto a wave which can create EMF as the magnets move,which can go into the storage capacitors, then released100 CHAPTER 6.
RUMBLES OF ROBOTSto change slightly the nature of the serpentine motion todirect the drone in a specific direction.
These can be incredibly powerful technology! Theocean can be a fantastic source of raw materials for thetrash wizards.
Note that for neutrally buoyant drones,this can serve to move them through the water belowthe surface.
One mode of operation might be to cruise afew meters above the bottom of the ocean, scanning forstuff to salvage, then dive and grab rocks to be negativelybuoyant once a target is found.
With just barely negative buoyancy, the rumble can float just above the targetas they pick it apart.
They then drop the weights, riseup, inflate bags to float(everything is made from rubber, and reversible air/vacuum/water pumps are in allthings), and pull up and bring material back to assemblycenters, which can also be floating robot rumble factories.
With ocean currents and waves as an energy source, andno hurry, these robots can work as slow as they have to,slowly making more and more of themselves until theycan have a global impact on ocean cleanup.
The water based propulsion system also is very appealing for boats.
I want a boat that runs on wave action, wind, and tides, to grab energy as it finds it, andthen use it as needed to move toward a destination.
Ican imagine this being just about kayak or canoe sized.
Icould also imagine a freighter that is meters or even 10’sof meters long.
That sounds small for a freighter, butimagine, again, that they’re a huge rumble that can be101easily scaled up.
This can be a freight swarm to movematerials across water.
How Robots ReproduceNot on their own! With help.
Robots can always ask forhelp, and it is our task as their designers and creators tobuild the information into them in the form of works ofart that makes it obvious how to repair and extend therobot.
A robot should also be constructed in such a waythat it is its own means of production: the components ofthe robot can be used as a machine to build more robotslike it.
This will require human effort, but both the physical tools and the information required to learn the skillsto duplicate the machine are built into the machine andobvious to find and use.
Modern technology is designedto scare you away from modifying it or interacting withit in any deep way.
We seek to build machines that dothe opposite: invite the user to get more deeply involved,building more, documenting that process, and extendingthe technology themselves for others to use.
I will illustrate this with an example.
One of the simplest robots will move itself around looking for energy,then when it finds some(generally a fast moving waterbody like a creek) it will turn itself into both a powerplant and a chemical plant, storing energy and chemicals extracted from the water(targeting human industrialwaste of various kinds).
This will involve a computer,102 CHAPTER 6.
RUMBLES OF ROBOTSsome motors and some sensors.
Other machines will beinvolved in large scale computer fabrication as outlinedin other sections of this work.
CyborgsA cyborg, or cybernetic organism, is a combination of artificial devices and living things.
I believe that we shouldblur these lines both in ourselves(we have already donethat) and in our fellow living things with whom we shouldbe able to more harmoniously co exist.
One other thing to observe about both ourselves andour fellow living things is that when examined closely weare almost all in a symbiotic relationship with other livingthings.
We need our gut bacteria to live, cows need fungiand bacteria both, trees rely on fungi for their roots to berobust, which ensures the survival of the whole forrest,etc.
The responsible development of cyborgs should combine living things with non living things in a thoughtfuland artistic and compassionate way.
I propose that the more communication oriented ofour fellow living things should be given access to ourcommunication networks.
I have no idea what happensif you build a virtual reality headset for a octopus orsquid and allow them to communicate with other squidsthousands of miles away.
But if they can put their headsin or not on their own, surely it’s worth trying? Perhaps we could allow them to smoothly join our society,103and co exist with us if we allowed them to communicatewith each other using our tools first.
A truly symbioticrelationship with cephalopods might end up with an arrangement where we help them live good lives using ourcontrol of the oceans and our sensor systems for weatherand they use their bioluminescent skin as display technology for some networked communication devices.
I would note that both for these water based creatures and for the various flying creatures including insects, birds, and bats, their brains may allow them tocontrol flying drones with much better skill than we can,and in large rumbles with much better flocking ability.
Perhaps another virtual reality rig is called for, allowingbirds and bats to connect with huge soaring drones sothat they can expand their minds the way we do withour machines.
We should not limit cyborg development to the obvious animals! Plants and fungi and various strange microlife should be also investigated at all levels.
What woulda slime mold cyborg look like? Something awesome, onemight hope.
And finally plants, when integrated withtechnology, can suddenly move! This leads us to the super ent, which is the next section.
Super EntsThe fractal mater reactor should be alive.
Trees, bushes,grass, etc.
can grow all around it, with roots going into104 CHAPTER 6.

RUMBLES OF ROBOTSvarious fractal channels which provide nutrients.
Theseliquid spaces can have various animals and fungi and microorganisms, creating a whole ecosystem.
Imagine anisland built up of such mater, the size of a small building, covered with trees.
Ambient energy is used to slowlybuild up and discharge electrical energy to operate philosophy engines which slowly walk the whole thing acrossthe landscape.
With little or even no human intervention,this lumbering living giant might spend decades crawlingup and down hills scouring for junk cars, which it turnsinto an evergrowing robot rumble that it can give awayto any passing humans for free at any time.
Building this kind of thing in the ocean can be incredibly powerful.
Whole floating islands filled with fractalreactor technology can wander the high seas, with the humans all underwater in bubbles to ride out storms, picking up storm energy and sea junk, and building a everlarger floating city deep out in the ocean.
This aquaticfractal techno city could exist even in a dead world ofviolent storms and acid oceans and extreme heat.
Machines that comb the ocean for contaminants, using waves go get energy to move around and sort andgrab stuff, potentially floating around for years beforebeing found based on a data stream that pulses out periodically, and eventually another type of robottendingrobot can grab it, extract the materials it’s gathered, andbring it to a floating factory robot rumble.
This kind ofrobot is important for the ecosystem of the jungle city in107the oceaninundated coastal post apocalypse.

And a World To Win!The Anthropocene is here.
Like it or not, it’s here.
Forthe next 1000 years our planet is going to be dominatedby the actions we choose to take as a civilization.
If westay on the track we’re on, the atmosphere and oceansheat up, massive desertification destroys wet ecosystemswhile rising oceans eat most of our cities, and the oceansbecome a toxic waste dump that cannot sustain life.
Ifwe do nothing that is clearly what will happen.
Or something worse involving nuclear holocaust.
Given these alternatives, what difference does it make how drasticallywe change things in the sea, air, and land? The opportunity to simply not let civilization get big enough todestroy the world has long passed us by now.
So is it so wrong to imagine the whole landscape filledwith these lumbering rumbles of rolling, slithering, hopping, and gliding robots? Is it wrong to let them reproduce with human help, but with very little labortime,allowing groups of people to build endlessly expandingrumble spheres around the world to create a world of total abundance? I say that it is not wrong.
Maybe if therewere a way to go back it would be a hard choice to dosomething that disturbs the balance of nature like this,but there isn’t.
108 CHAPTER 6.
RUMBLES OF ROBOTSThis is what the trash wizard wants to make possiblein the world: endless streams of material and data moving through the physical world with robots made fromtrash, which encompass our whole human environment.
Maybe not the whole world, but enough of it.
A worldof abundance using the rumble sphere and value circlescould exist outside of the states and corporations.
It doesnot need land, just someplace to move to–it is all mobileby default.
The trash wizards build the needed expertise up and document it and teach it so that any groupof people can create this kind of culture anywhere, specific to their individual cultural needs and the availableresources in whatever geographical area they’re in.

Chapter 7Free Drugs,SlimeZistors, and IonMagicTechnology Should be Slimy and DirtyLook around you.
We are leaky bags of salty dirty water,and we are surrounded by mud and dirty rocks on allsides.
This is the world we live and grow and thrive in.
It’s how our food grows, it’s how our waste is disposedof, it’s how we get our raw materials and how we disposeof our “trash”.
And yet this is not how our technology is.
Our technology is, instead, obsessed with the cleanand “pure”.
It is obsessed with order, with perfect rows of110111things, with straight lines and perfectly geometric circles.
The very structure of all our technology represents ourworship of numbers and math and military order, as wellas of mining and minerals.
I will go into more detail on this later, but I believethe structure of the modern micofabricated circuit is aproduct of the white supremacist ideology of the far rightlunatics who started Silicon Valley.
They were, like allof their kind, obsessed with “purity”, order, and forcingeveryone to march to a perfectly timed clock.
This isborne out in a machine architecture which they pretendis a product of some kind of technical evolution but whichis just as much a function of their capitalist religion asthe rows of decorative stone columns they place outsidetheir buildings of power.
If, rather than Evil Machines, we want our technologyto be more human and more life like, it should resemblewhat we see around us in the living world.
This meansit should be largely filled with and immersed in dirtywater.
And it should be capable of moving fluids andgasses around at around with simple circulation systems.
Another key distinction of living systems is that theydo not distinguish between material transport, data transport, energy, and electrical transport.
All of these involvethe flow of ions and various big molecules through fluids.
Our nonliving technical systems crudely split thesefunctions off from one another.
We have banished pureinformation to the domain of “computers”, all controlled112CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICby the all powerful Master Control Program of the Central Processing Unit.
Fluids flow as needed for coolingfor chemicals, but are clearly lower in the hierarchy thaninformation which rules all in today’s “tech” world.
Ionsin fluid rarely take a deliberate role unless it’s in a living system and cannot be avoided(people drinking sportdrinks with electrolytes, or use of acid in car batteries).
Moving Fluids AroundOne type of magic that must be wielded if we expectto have a decent life is potion making.
This means mixing fluids, moving them around with pumps, compressingthem, running electricity through them, and also doingthings with gasses of various kinds.
This is needed to efficiently compost waste at a high speed safely and to buildup plant growth infrastructure fast for food production.
It is also where novel chemicals and various life savingdrugs come from.
Fluidics is generally a term used to refer to the useof fluids in ways that are analogous to electronic circuits.
Since Trash Magic seeks to eliminate the boundaries between fluid flow and electronics, I want to integrate thisword into our vocabulary to help blur that line.
Here Iwill briefly describe how the fluidic systems will initiallywork in Trash Magic.
The full technical description ofthis system will take up much of the future volumes whichwill come after the Manifesto.
113We need to do all the things with fluids that livingsystems do, as well as some things they do not.
Everything we use to build with should also be used for fluidics.
This means we need fluid channels to be cut into stone,wood, plastic, and metal.
Part of the initial Trash Magicset of skills and tools will be to enable this.
Probablythe easiest to do are the two I’ve done already: woodand plastic.
The use of salvaged plastic for fluidics is worth focusing on here because it’s such a hallmark of our way ofdoing things.
The thing that makes plastic special forour purposes is how easily it can be edited after beingformed.
No plastic structure in our system is permanent.
Any joint, valve, pump, chamber, or tube can atsome future time be reshaped into other components asneeded.
How do we do build a fluidic system that easily selfedits? Look at blood.
Blood is not just a fluid, it’s arich medium of machines and information of all kindswhich can do a huge array of tasks in the living body.
Soshould it be with our constructions.
If the channels are allfilled with fluid, solid objects can be moved through thesystem using fluid flow, rather than a propulsion systemor external control tool of some kind.
All that is neededto edit the plastic walls of the tubes are simple tools thatcombine heat and force to shape and weld.
Thus one ofthe elements of this has to be many sizes of simple robotthat do this work by remote control at various scales.
114CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICThe issue of scale brings me to the next topic: thefractal nature of our systems.
A fractal has selfsimilarityover different size scales.
Mathematical fractals can haveinfinite numbers of scales of selfsimilarity, but as I’verepeatedly pointed out, this type of pure math has nophysical reality and we should look to things that actuallyexist in nature as a guide for what is or is not usefulfrom math.
Look at a fern.
It is usually pointed to as anexample of selfsimilarity to show how relevant fractalsare to the world around us.
But notice a fern is only selfsimilar up to a point in both directions.
As you go upto the scale of a whole forrest, a fern is just a spec, withno fernlike nature, and as you go down to the scale ofatoms, that fernlike nature is also lost.
Thus we seek tobuild things which are fractal, but not infinitely fractal.
Channels through the plastic, wood and stone shouldbe filled with fluid much of the time, but can also beused for various gasses including air, as well as possiblyvacuum in some cases.
For pumps, the simplest solution is the first choice.
This means hydrostatic pressure from existing bodies ofwater are a first choice for an overall pressure bias, andfor user control the first choice is direct manual manipulation of flexible membranes.
Rather than a user controlling a button that controls an electrical signal whichcontrols a machine that controls the fluid, I think it’s always better to have direct connection between your bodyand the solid that controls the fluid.
This means flexible115membranes and various tubes to transform up or downin pressure or volume.
Something that we can try to do with Magic that thecapitalists avoid is work with chaos and complexity byusing our skill as living minds to learn how to do that.
Forfluids, this I would argue this means that vortices shouldplay a larger role.
We can learn to generate them andmanipulate them, and that can be used to do chemistryat a very physically specific region of a fluid.
It mighttake skill to control a fluid probe in the right way to makea vortex that can be used to carry out a useful chemicalreaction, but in our world view that is ok.
Human skillsare better than fancy machines.
The vortex ring(of whichsmoke rings are an example), in particular, is a reallybeautiful thing which is under used by the techno priestsfor obvious reasons.
I use the term “fractal reactor” to refer to the wholeclass of technology/art that will be built up in the waydescribed here, since various reactions are a main goal ofthe systems.
Brew EverythingIt has become clear from recent advances in mainstreambiotechnology that almost anything can be brewed usingwhat the capitalists call “industrial fermentation”.
Thismeans that micro organisms are cultivated and environments are controlled so that those organisms can create116CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICproducts that are useful to humans.
This generally involves controlling temperature and pressure and flow andmixing accurately, as well as making sure vessels are notcross contaminated with the “wrong” organisms.
One of the most important things to make free fromcapitalist control are drugs.
All drugs.
Conventionalwestern medicines to reduce swelling, AIDS drugs, painkillers, specialized treatments of all sorts of disease–allthese must be made free.
The capitalist system buildshuge centralized factories to carry out “industrial fermentation” so that these things can be done for profitover a very large number of people.
If we are to eliminate these centralized factories, we need to be able tomake very small batches of safe, high quality medicine.
Making 10 doses of a drugs is never relevant to a capitalist, so we have no idea how hard or easy that is.
Ourtask as we redirect basic science research away from profits is to change what questions we ask to better reflectour values.
Building a fractal reactor that can make a6 months supply of insulin, then can be reprogrammedeasily to make 100 doses of ibuprofen is simply not something the capitalists will ever do.
But we must do it.
We will need to be comfortable working with DNAquickly and efficiently to do this.
I think this will involve moving away from the current system that uses aton of statistics and computer work and fancy chemicalsand figure out how to use living things and our electricalprobes to physically manipulate DNA directly using elec117trochemical devices that integrate with various nanometer scale ion channels.
I essentially argue that as ourtechnical systems look more like living systems in otherways that building this type of thing that comes closer tohow real life works will be easier and easier as our scienceprogresses.
I think it is impossible to overstate the potential valueof really free medicine.
This is one of the ways the capitalists fail the most painfully to care for the people intheir society.
If the choice is 500 dollars a month for acapitalist medicine or zero dollars for a free medicine thatis also targeted specifically to your personal metabolismand genetic code, it will not be difficult to convince people of the inferiority of capitalism.
As with food, clean water is almost too obvious tobelabor–everyone knows we need free water, and everyone who’s not completely brain washed can see capitalistbehavior in regard to clean water is pure evil.
Free water:we need it.
Capitalism is a failed system, time to moveon.
Ion MagicLife is electric.
In life, when information flows in a nervepulse or when we pump molecular fuel in and out of acell, electrical charge flows from one place to another.
When electricity flows in salty dirty water, it is generallyin the form of ions, which are atoms that have either lost118CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICor gained an electron, making them carry a nonzero totalcharge.
Chemists use the “+” and “” to indicate thatan atom has either lost or gained charge, and how much.
When salt is dissolved in water, the chlorine turns intoCl ions and the sodium becomes Na+ ions.
Nerve impulses involve the flow of K+ ions, which arepotassium with a missing electron.
So when you eat foodthat has potassium as a nutrient it appears as a solid butwhen your nerves use it to operate it’s an ion.
Ions arecentral to what makes life life rather than just dead matter.
Thus I identify the ion as another of the fundamentalalchemy elements along with earth, air, water, and fire.
Most of what we call chemistry and biology are infact electrical processes.
If we want to integrate our artinto those processes we need to be able to interact withflowing ions, both detecting and controlling them.
Anintegral tool of the Trash Magician is thus a probe whichallows us to do these things in a simple way.
How do we interact with ions? By batting them backand forth like a cat with a ball of yarn.
A capacitor is asimple electrical device that stores charge.
Pretty mucheverything in the universe is a capacitor at some level,but our industry has built them to specified values andthey’re very easy to control and salvage.
The behaviorof a charging capacitor is very much like that of a tankof water.
How fast you can fill or empty a tank of waterdepends on both the capacity of the tank to hold waterand the conductance of the pipe you drain it or fill it119through.
If you can change the direction of flow quicklycompared to how long it takes to fill or empty the tank,you can set any of various average water levels, and rampthe flow rate up or down as well.
Going back to our electrical probe, the capacitor is the water tank and in ourcase the actual fluid we are connecting to is like the waterpipe(but for electric charge).
This is perhaps confusingbecause I’m making an analogy between two fairly similar systems, but it should become more clear after youactually get to see and use this machine.
This tool seems obscure but it is extremely useful.
The first thing it does is measure the electrical conductance(how much current flows for a given voltage difference) in real time.
It does this by choosing an averagecapacitor voltage, then alternating the flow of electricalcurrent with just the right rate to keep that balance fora given oscillation level.
This oscillation in current willcreate a signal the frequency of which is set by conductance.
With amplifiers and speakers, this means conductance can be played out as a musical note! We have thuscreated a combination musical and scientific instrument,which allows you to both work on chemicals as pure artand to measure their physical and chemical properties.
A hand held or machine controlled(using the Tripod)probe like this with audio feedback can be used to imageobjects based on their electrical environment in a fluid.
With many wheels and belts to take large motion downto small motion it should be possible to use this to image120CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICobjects far smaller than we can see with visible light,even with the most powerful microscopes.
A truly freeform of nano imaging like this should immediately haveimpact on what science we can do for free, since it willenable imaging much faster and in more places than thecapitalist science establishment can access.
Another key element for imaging is vibrational driveof fluids.
Part of the first phase of early Trash Magictechnology will be a generic mechanical vibrational drive.
By using various mechanical resonators it should be possible to drive water waves at many different frequencies.
With a time delay made by a very simple circuit whichthe Trash Magician can control with a simple knob, itshould be possible to time electrical imaging with the vibration of the water, allowing a scan to be quickly madein whatever axis the wave is on with potentially videorates.
This is how our technology integrates together! Sticksand rocks and plastic trash are used to make a fluid circuit with electrical connections, then another stick withan electrical probe is used to play the fluid as a musicalinstrument, and another stick is used to create a vibration, and a bunch more circuits made from trash are usedto make a visual display from this.
The time delayed imaging can also be used with optical microscopy in combination with the electrical probe.
A strobe light which is triggered by the mechanical oscillations can be tuned in its time delay to create amaz121ing artistic effects with projected light from optical microcopy of fluid channels filled with living things! Thiswill get much more attention in the next volume of thiswork, but suffice it to say here that some simple opticsfor both microscopy and projection must be integratedinto Trash Magic sticks and rocks and trash for this tobe ever present to connect us with the microscopic worldin an artistic way.
Part of this system should involveprojection on a wall or screen, and part should involveintegration into goggles for an immersive experience.
So far I’ve discussed this probe for imaging, but alsomade some vague claims that it can do more than that.
Using vibration and probe motion and pumps to controlfluid flow while also using the probe and various otherwires in the fluid to control voltage allows us to controlthe local “electrochemical potential”.
This quantity isessentially what tells an ion a place is good to be or not.
It is how you get ions to move, the essence of Ionic TrashMagic.
Anywhere you have ions in your fluid(which iseverywhere) there is some value of this electrochemicalpotential.
There is thus always a preferred direction forions to flow.
So this probe is nothing less than a magic wand thatlets us control how ions flow in the whole world thatwe care about(dirty salty water)! What atom these ionscome from can be controlled both by flowing chemicalsaround and by changing which metal our wires are madefrom.
If we then combine that with the ability to move122CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICliving things through our plumbing(bacteria, tiny worms,aquatic fungi, etc.
) which all also control ion flow, wehave truly Magical powers over this world.
Ion Magic.
What can we do with these powers? I don’t reallyknow yet.
The fact that things will be easy and free totry will create a massive flow of amazing discoveries withthis once it’s deployed in a truly free way.
I think that itwill be possible, however, to very easily integrate biological systems with electrical systems, making things likeDNA sequencing and also neural interfaces exponentiallyeasier.
I also think it will be possible to make potionsthat are right on the edge of some transition, such asfrom liquid to solid, and move the probe around to 3dprint solids right in a liquid, then go back and edit thatsolid, adding and removing parts as needed later.
This isfar less fantastic than it sounds, collagen, the structuralmolecule found in blood is known to be fairly simple tocontrol using electricity in much more crude apparatusthan what I propose here.
I’m fairly sure the only reasonwe are not 3d printing with collagen in a stone dish withsome trash based magic stick is that no one has tried.
Solet’s do that! And bury capitalist science in the landfillof history.
The SlimeZistorI have coined the term SlimeZistor here to refer to thehybrid electrical and fluidic elements which will make up123our systems.
The idea is that I’m not sure what theslime will be(swamp scum, tap water, blood plasma, orange juice, etc.
) or even how the electrical leads will beconnected, but I’m willing to draw a black box and say“in this box are both fluid channels and wires and they’rea SlimeZistor”.
I’m leaving it open! One of the things I find infuriating about capitalist device physics is the endless classification of tedious sub species of device.
Who cares?Most of the time, I want a switch or some memory orsome energy flow or something–and I never want to haveto care what long acronym the specific device used todo that has.
It’s the virus of professionalism rearing it’sugly head! The more complex the system of classificationof basic electronic devices is, the more highly paid member of the technocratic priesthood can be supported byit.
Those devices are never transparent and thus neverfree: much tedious and otherwise useless data must beabsorbed to use them, making them very nonfree.
I will say the SlimeZistor will involve all the fractalreactor stuff described here as well as the electrochemicalprobe, vibrational motors, simple oscillators with capacitors, optical circuits and the like–the elements of the restof Trash Magic.
We are attacking the divisions made bythe number worshippers here.
Just as everything in theuniverse can store a little charge and is therefore a capacitor, everything in the universe can be operated as aswitch and therefore is a transistor.
If everything we care124CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICabout is made of some form of slime, it’s all SlimeZistors!Editing Capitalist ElectronicsIt is undeniable that the capitalists have built an impressive wealth of microchips! Just about everything theymake now is crammed with absurdly complex micro electronic circuits, with millions or billions of transistors onthem, running at absurdly fast speeds with clocks of millions or billions of beats per second.
Let’s use all that,but not buy into it.
To connect with the electronics we first rip it all outusing destructor robots.
These can be probes in tripodsthat rip apart the cases so that the raw circuits are in ourfluid.
We then use the probe mentioned above to growmetal wires right in the slime which connect the variouspads of the circuit with our SlimeZistor based circuits.
We need to build up a protocol for using chips this waywithout fully integrating our technology with the horriblesoftware which pollutes the capitalist chips.
This will bea trial and error process, and we must not be held backby theory–we must simply do it and then write down howwe did it.
As I said above, I think you can see evil ideologies polluting every atom in the modern capitalist chip controlledby the Silicon Valley cartel.
I think it is worth mentioning here that one of the founders of Silicon Valley wasWilliam Shockley, an infamous white supremacist with125many extreme views on race and racial purity.
The engineering manifestation of white supremacy and worshipof numbers and military force can be seen in the perfect rectangular arrays, rigid clock system and extremelypure semiconductors used in modern micro fabrication.
No more fascist micro chips! We must smash them all,and absorb them into something better.
This also givesus a more complete form of cyborg technology than thecapitalists will ever have, since the SlimeZistor will bridgethe gap between the salvaged capitalist chips and the living systems that are in the fractal reactor tubes.
Plasma and PlasmaDifferent scientists use the word “plasma” to describe twovery different things.
One, used by medical people andbiologists, refers to the main fluid of blood, the mediumin which blood cells drift around.
The other refers toionized gasses, and is most commonly seen in various gaslight tubes and glowing lightning displays.
Trash Magicseeks to unite the shattered pieces of science.
To thatend, we must bring the plasmas under one roof!By this I mean that I want to be comfortable that anygiven art piece we build might have both blood plasmain it, which can be used to create a 3d object made ofprinted collagen for instance, and tubes carrying for instance oxygen plasma, which can be used to aggressivelyclean surfaces for various applications where that is use126CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICful.
Oxygen can be extracted from the water with electricity fairly easily, and waterweeddriven vacuum pumpscan create low pressure oxygen tubes.
Waterwheel drivenhigh voltage generators can then be used to ionize thegas, making a nice glowing tool that cuts through allkinds of dirt molecules readily available anywhere weneed it.
Let’s bring it all together! Another plasma that should be readily available is methane.
Methane should be used as a process gas formaking carbon nano electronics(nanotubes, graphene, etc.).
Since part of a complete technological set will alwaysbe disposal of biological waste including various typesof feces, we will always have biological reactors makingmethane from that process.
Rather than release that gasinto the atmosphere it makes sense to always use it asa process gas to make practical things from carbon (also including diamond, which can be useful for many things).
The human solid waste reactors will combine the biological reactors described earlier in this section with variousfractal reactors that use the outputs of that initial conversion system.
Robots specialized in picking throughthe mass of waste from the future toilets also need tobe built, possibly as cyborgs with existing compostingorganisms like worms.
The Future: Free Nanotechnology What all this is really heading towards is the realization of many of the dreams of what the capitalists havecalled “molecular nanotechnology”.
That is a hypothetical technology in which atomically precise control of matter is carried out.
Much hype was built up in the 1990sby people inside the science establishment, which led toa lot of funding and very little real advancement.
Likeall capitalist technology, the sketches of the hypotheticalfuture technology these people made involved extremelyprecise and accurate control of every atom over many sizescales.
We know from looking at living things that this isneither needed nor wanted, and I think that’s why theyfailed.
We need to build up a more artistic approach tomoving and placing atoms, and one which is more integrated with different systems.
With electrical gas plasma reactors we can createcarbon nanostructures with control over branching andshape, making carbon nano electronic circuits.
With iontransport and mechanical probes interacting with livingthings, the ion magic of living things can be used by oursystem.
With imaging of the environment for ions in solutions we can have a fast, simple and experimentally relevant nano imaging system deployed for free everywhere.
Ultimately what this leads to is not just complete setsof technology which don’t need capitalism, but sets ofMagical components that vastly exceed in power what128CHAPTER 7.
FREE DRUGS, SLIMEZISTORS, ANDION MAGICthe capitalists have ever built or will ever build.

Chapter 8Magic Tales and MagicLoreMoving Beyond MoneyMoney is a failure.
I have gone into some detail aboutthis in the earlier chapters and I will attempt to not belabor it here.
How, exactly does it fail, though? I sayit’s wrong to add up human value using numbers, butwhat exactly is the mechanism by which this causes somuch misery? There are many mechanisms, but one thatI think is worth starting this chapter off with is its dissipative nature.
As money flows through our society itdissipates.
At each stage from the banks out through allthe people working and selling things and paying eachother to when it comes back to the bankers, money is131132CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LORE“lost” along the way, usually to various parasitic organisms like landlords and online payment gateways that addno value but simply take from the system.
So one feature I believe we need to look for in a valuesystem beyond money is that it should be additive ratherthan dissipative: rather than transactions making valuedecrease, as they do for both money and the physicalgoods capitalist claim as “property”, we want value toincrease as transactions happen.
This goes against everything capitalism stands for, as it doesn’t work withcurrency based on integer numbers, mining or humanmisery, but that’s the point.
The fact that there is “notenough money” to do all the many things that need doing in our society is partly because most of us do nothave the ability to make it.
We can get it from someone else, but ultimately they had to get it from someonewho got it from someone who got it from a banker andof course all those transactions paid the dissipations taxto the various parasitic rent collectors.
We can’t just sitdown, think really hard, make a thing, talk to some people and make something of value.
We can make a thingthen sell it for money, but that is no longer a closed system.
If there are just the two of us, alone in the woodswe cannot create value in the money based system without also involving a banker.
Any system of value thatwe use to replace money must have the ability to growin value and scale in a closed system, without any needto communicate with bankers, governments or others of133their kind.
It is also worth at least mentioning the socalled “alternatives” to money in the form of electronic currencylike Bit Coin and the “time dollar” or other currenciesbased on selling hours of your life away.
These are all stillmoney.
They use numbers to represent value, and address almost none of the underlying problems with modern money.
In the special case of Bit Coin the creators have actually managed to build perhaps the only money systemworse than central bank debt currency.
They have replaced central bankers with members of the technocraticpriesthood who answer to no one and are some of themost unpleasant and anti social people in our society.
And they have replaced an inflationary system with a deflationary one, making currency ever more scarce as timegoes on.
I wish I were creative enough to have inventedBit Coin as a sort of counter example of technocraticcapitalism gone mad, much like the Schroedinger’s catstory used to show the absurdity of quantum superposition(which still appears to accurately describe the world).
It would have been a great thought experiment to showin a series of amusing anecdotes just what a horrible ideathis is, but alas, this is not fiction and we all have to dealwith Bit Coin people for the foreseeable future.
134CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREInfinite and Infinitesimal ValueWhen you say you want to move beyond money for keeping track of value, the capitalist will typically turn purpleand start spitting about how absurd the very idea is ofdoing anything like this.
They have been trained to dothis, and it’s a part of the immune system the capitalistmachine has built up over the centuries.
However, theyknow perfectly well that values without any numericalequivalent are quite common in and essential for our society in even its current form.
Our society and indeedall societies have concepts of value outside finite number.
Both “priceless” and “worthless” items are quite commonin any system.
That which is called “worthless” by capitalists areoften the feeds we will use as “Trash” in Trash Magic,infinite supplies of things given zero numerical value bythe capitalists.
Returning to the example from a earlierchapter, the dog turd on the side of a street is an example of something viewed as “worthless” or “trash” by thecapitalists.
To take this example farther, what wouldit look like to attempt to apply capitalist “economics”to the dog turd? Over some days it will be digested byinsects, bacteria and fungi.
Once some atoms from theturd have been consumed by a fly, does the fly own them?Who owns the fly? Or perhaps the fly is a liability, whoseis that? If the fly is eaten by a bat who then uses thosecalories to also eat the mosquito which was going to give135me malaria surely the fly is now an asset, but whose?Mine? Or the bat? But who owns the bat? And if Ireturn to the turd a couple weeks later and it’s gone, didit “depreciate” to use the jargon of accountants? Depreciating assets can generally be written off as a discounton your taxes in most countries.
How would I do thatfor the dog turd? Perhaps if the turd was on land thatI owned and I had a numerical tally of the molecularwealth in the turd I could then calculate how fast theflies are taking away this great wealth and somehow turnthis into numbers and then a tax writeoff.
But surelythe molecular wealth in the bellies of the wellfed fliesare now an appreciating asset.
Is that then to be taxed?Who owns the flies? It’s all just nonsense! The vast universe around us of “worthless” things proves the extremelimitation of the capitalist worldview to even basicallydescribe our environment.
But what about the “priceless”? This is also an extremely familiar concept in every capitalist society and isalso one in which their methods of assessing value completely and catastrophically fail.
When it applies to anindividual this is usually called “sentimental value”, andapplies to wellloved personal things.
This might be a tshirt which was purchased for very little and is too wornto still wear but which was worn on some long journey.
More often the most valuable personal treasures are thosewhich were given to us by others.
We also use the conceptof priceless to refer to those things with shared cultural136CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREvalue.
Perhaps a capitalist can put a numerical price tagon things like the various stone temples of our differenthuman societies from centuries past, but we all know thatis not the real value.
When a ancient temple valued bythe local government at some arbitrary number of unitsof bank debt is destroyed no one in the world would daresay that this is really the same as that much bank debtbeing destroyed.
It’s not the same, because there arevalues in these cultural artifacts which cannot ever beadded up using numbers.
An example of priceless value familiar to some students of American popular culture is from the film PulpFiction from the 1990s.
A character played by the spectacular Christopher Walken presents a watch to the sonof his dead friend, and in one of the greatest monologsrecorded on film explains the priceless nature of the watchin the form of a story.
The story is not about the watchitself but about what happened to the watch–it’s not really about the thing but the people.
The watch ends uprepresenting a four generation story of a male family tradition of warrior values.
Within that culture it has trulyinfinite value.
All this is shown as a flashback for a maincharacter, to explain why he is willing to lose everythingincluding his own life to save the watch.
None of thatis to tell time, to store value for retirement or to hoardmetal.
The value of the watch is entirely based on human values and cannot possibly be translated to finitenumbers.
137I would propose a system of values where we all haveour own personal Christopher Walken telling the bestpossible stories about our things, which give value thecapitalists cannot possibly add up with numbers.
Thereare many ways to do this.
In the end what all of themhave in common is that they lead to a value system thattakes more from the study of folklore than from the studyof numbers.
So the structure of a post capitalist valuesystem will take its basic shape from folklore.
Just as folklore is incredibly varied, from wood carvings of ancestors to riddles and jokes to songs and epicpoems, the tools we use to express value in industrialproduct should be as diverse as any other kind of lore.
Tales and LoreThis discussion of “lore” brings me to two jargon termsI will introduce for Trash Magic industry/art: tales andlore.
Things in general should have both a tale and loreif they are to exist in a value system after capitalism.
A tale is exactly like the story above with ChristopherWalken and the gold watch.
Part of the power of thatstory is that it keeps going: the viewers of the film see yetanother dramatic component of the story, which presumably will be passed on to yet another generation eventually.
In this case it is entirely oral, although of course inthis case it is a tale within a tale since we are watchinga film which tells a made up story of an oral tradition.
I138CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREthink there are many ways to do this, the most obviousbeing purely oral, although the universal ability of people to both upload videos to youtube and watch themthere using the nowubiquitous smartphone argues thatonline video archives might be a way to combine oraltradition with simple and free recordings.
Books, poems,carved murals, paintings, decorative rope work and songsall might also be a part of the tale.
But whatever we endup doing, the point is everything should have some sortof tale.
That tale might be “this was made in part of agiant assembly run of 10,000 units in some factory thatactually sold them for money,” but that’s still a morecomplete tale than we usually get under capitalism.
Andit’s just the beginning! Over time, a thing will have stuffhappen to it, and all that should get added to the tale.
The value of that tale will clearly go up as it gets passedaround.
Unlike capitalism, which encourages hoarding, it’s clearthat giving things away to whoever will make the best useof them vastly increases their value over simple hoarding.
“This thing was in my closet for 10 years” is clearly amuch less powerful story than “this thing was given tosomeone who hitchhiked across the continent with it” orsomething else where the use and need are more substantial.
So that is the tale, but what is lore? Lore is theknowledge that is part of building a thing, and all theassociated culture that goes into that.
In our present so139ciety, lore already always exists around things that aremade, whether it is the lumberjack’s knowledge of howto safely fell a tree, the programmers knowledge of howto use some key hardware driver, or the factory worker’sskill on a drill press.
However, as with the tale of creation, this lore is not passed on to the user in capitalismbecause it generally separates us so rigidly into separatecategories: maker, owner, engineer, artist, user, worker,etc.
No more! We need lore that can really be passed on,the way operating a car or changing lightbulbs is nowpassed on in capitalist society.
Again, this is probablyeasiest to start with face to face oral tradition, whereyou directly teach in a hands on way the future user howto make a thing.
But just as with the tale, it can be aproblem to carry it through a completely oral traditionbecause of all the times we want to pass goods on toothers without having to travel, so we need ways to recordboth tales and lore.
Again, the recording of videos anduploading to youtube is a good place to start.
Also forlarger artifacts, passing along some type of flash drive orother cheap and small memory which holds all the filesfor the designs as well as videos and images can helpphysically transmit tales and lore without the Internetor travel.
Ultimately we should be developing our own memorysystem which can record analog video in the molecularstructure of grown minerals of various kinds after full140CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREnanotech is working.
Before that we should be growing interface mineral structures to found flash memoryfrom salvaged trash which can store stuff, and before thatoff the shelf flash cards can be decoratively incorporatedinto various artifacts, with graphical artistic instructionswhich direct the future user to the media.
Note again that capitalists are already using theseideas in their own ways.
It has always been commonin history for various types of organized crime(includingboth government and various lords of capital) to patronize the arts to create “priceless” cultural artifacts(e.
g.
thewhole renaissance), then to set up a market system where“stolen” works of art are held in illegal warehouses andtraded around as valueholding items outside of the bankersystem.
This is well documented in the literature of arttheft history, and proves there is precedent for art beingused as a type of currency outside of government andbanker control.
If the art market has always played asubversive role in capitalism, surely the ability to createinfinite streams of art can even more so.
What I hope I have shown with this section is thatthe ideas required to build value into industrial productswithout money are already familiar.
All we need is tolook at what is already there and thoughtfully apply it tothe tools we have and we can immediately do interestingwork outside capitalism.
What, specifically does thatlook like? My example will be the things I actually buildin the process of creating this volume.
The fact that they141are the coproducts of writing this book is the initial taleof them.
The lore will be the documentation I put in laterparts of this book about how to make them.
And as Igive it to you as a gift(which I will do as many times as Ican as well as I can) that act of gift will be another stepof the tale.
And the lore will carry directly from me toyou both through reading this book and talking about itand also through the instruction that I hope to deliver toall who seek it over the next few years, showing everyonehow to build on and grow and make more of all this.
Ifit does grow, the value of these tales will continue to risefor all of us, from me as creator to you as participantand onward to your successors.
Just as capitalism tendsto lead to a repeated pattern of they pyramid where thelowest and largest level is always crushed by the higherones, we hope to build a future that also has repeatingpatterns, but those patterns are ones of abundance.
It’s ok to start small! Take meaningless junk, paintit in a way that tells a story, glue stuff to it to make ituseful, then give it to a friend, tell the story, and passthat on.
If they do the same back to you but with something else, you have now both created a greater valuethan you started with, and with no bank or governmentintervention and no numbers.
Also note that this is not barter.
Economists loveto use barter as a club to beat nonmoneyworshippersover the head with.
But as David Graeber tells us, thisis largely made up for that purpose–barter has always142CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREprimarily been something used with untrusted people inessentially capitalist ventures.
It’s still numberworship,still numerical values used for everything because yousimply have to find direct equivalents for everything.
Youdo not need Christopher walken monologs for barter–clearly a problem.
Like bit coin and the time dollar, Icast the ideas of barter aside as capitalist propagandaand religious nonsense, to be mostly ignored as we try tobuild a better world.
The FeedPeople love their feeds! As horrible as they often are,the various social media feeds that dominate modern lifeare fantastically powerful tools.
In Facebook, Twitter,Youtube, Instagram, and probably a hundred other sitesI don’t know about, users have the ability to quickly scrollup and down though a timeline that mixes the outputtimeline of many very different entities.
Often the timeline you see will mix local news, foreign news, personalannouncements from friends, artistic output of variousartists, promotions for other artists, weather data, andnumerous other types of useful and (potentially)interestinginformation.
Given that these feeds are easier and easier to buildwith modern software, are generally free and are wellknown and liked already, I think they should play a partin how we pass lore and tales along.
Perhaps things you143make can each have a tumblr feed, and you pass thepassword along to the next person who gets it, they keepadding to the tale and lore both on the feed, then pass italong in the same way when they’re done.
Or a youtubeaccount, with google used to do following, or various waysof using Twitter.
I’m not sure, but what I propose isthat we keep in mind this basic concept(independent ofimplementation) and then just try it and see what works.
There will be many solutions found by many people overtime.
Should those feeds be encrypted? Maybe.
That isup to you, I want to be completely open about this, andwould hope that some will go a fully open route and others will build something with very strong physical encryption.
Many paths for many people should be a constantgoal in this value system, and that includes how the feedsare transmitted.
Geometry of ValueIn earlier versions of this manifesto I got sucked in todrawing all sorts of strange diagrams of how I see thegeometry of capitalist money.
You can draw pyramidsof many kinds that represent how the top extract fromthe bottom in capitalism.
But who cares? They mostlydon’t need geometry since their number worship regardsnumbers higher than shapes.
144CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREWhat is much more interesting than adding to theanticapitalist crank literature is trying to build up a geometry of value outside of capitalism.
The first thingthat comes to mind for this is the circle.
As many people have now pointed out, if we want to make our valuesystems more sustainable and more like Nature the circleis a commonly recurring shape.
Nature is full of circularprocesses, and often objects, like droplets of water, formin a spherical shape, generalizing the circle.
As with the“feed” mentioned above, none of this is literal, but thentaking math literally is what got the number worshipersin trouble.
It’s an image we put in our minds when designing processes.
It’s helpful to think of a circle whenbuilding a mental model for how economics might workwith tales and lore outside capitalism.
Other geometric ideas can have a powerful resonancein how we decide to structure value without number.
Those include various fractal patterns such as the spiral or the fernlike structure.
Also any of the numerouspolyhedra that mean things to people, including the various oddly shaped dice used for various role playing gamescan be useful.
The helix has become a universal symbolof life since the discovery of the structure of DNA, and isalso used for screws, a fairly universal simple machine.
Ahelix can be a great geometric metaphor for a stable relationship between a pair of entities that are intertwinedand move around relative to each other in a simple way.
And finally the crystal lattice can be powerful, albeit with145the hazard that it has too much of a number worshippingflavor.
The tree is a powerful image in just about every possible belief system, including the scientific understandingof the living world.
Of course trees of all kinds and everypossible part of their world should be a part of our valuesystem imagery.
Trash Magic ConveyorOne of the key elements of the capitalist monopoly oncontrol of goods is all the parts of the supply chain afterthe factory.
This includes shipping, warehousing, distribution, display in stores, transport from stores to homes,disposal, and possibly a used market.
We need this as well, of course.
How do we get thingsfrom where they are made to where they are used? Whatif I just want to make things and send them on? Or makenothing and just grab things?There need to be conveyor systems that move goodsalong on their own without help.
This can be lazy rivers,skylines, or air tubes.
In the first version of this I imagine them being very localized, making a sort of TrashMagic equivalent of the conveyor belt sushi concept on acreek.
I am imagining that one of us will sit by the creek,building up the conveyor and making some things, thenput the things on the conveyor and move on, allowingfuture passers by to take what they want and continue146CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREthe story(increasing each things value as this makes aninteresting story).
If even a small fraction of those peopledecide to make more and put them back on the conveyorit is easy to see how this can lead to an exponentiallygrowing economic system outside the system of capitalism.
It’s art, craft, and outdoor amusement.
Also somescience and technology and industry–but not capitalism,as no numbers are used at all in the “transaction” of making a thing and setting it on the conveyor or grabbing itoff the conveyor, watching some videos, and making somemore.
Our system of goods distribution can also involve simple self powered drones that dumbly move across thelandscape powering themselves, getting fixed by passerby,moving goods where they go, and navigating by somesimple formula(head north, head downstream, follow thecold, follow the wind, find a city etc.
) This sounds hardat this point in time of course, as we are just gettingstarted.
The simplest possible free distribution system Iknow of is the message in a bottle: you write a messageon a piece of paper, put it in a sealed bottle(so the airmakes it float) and throw it out to sea.
I can personallyattest that doing this can result in strangers from faraway writing a physical letter in response.
Surely innovative technology/art can also be delivered this way, andacross national and language and culture barriers as well!Large numbers of us who put these bottle with beautiful and useful art into the water at one end of a major147ocean current(like the Japanese current that pushes water from Japan to Alaska bringing bamboo to all Alaskankids to play with) and the artifacts will be received inlarge numbers by people in a far away land with a totally different culture and language and nationality.
Ifyou take this route, clarity is key! A picture is wortha thousand words, and videos should not require verbalunderstanding if it’s possible to communicate purely bydemonstration.
If you know the language of the reader,or even have an educated guess get a translation of atleast enough to tell them how to translate the rest(markthe language you use in many other languages).
The final and possibly most important leg of our basicsupply line will be the human courier.
Nothing is morepersonal than personal delivery! Let’s try to make thingsas much as possible tailored to people we meet in real life,possibly in the course of making more things, and givethem directly as gifts to those people.
This makes talesand lore of a very detailed nature possible, both oral andwith various media, and with clear one on one hands oninstruction in the actual lore required to make the thing.
The hands on courier method will almost certainly by themost powerful vector for spreading exponentially since itwill have a higher quality of transmission of the abilityto make things.
Of course I don’t have to start all this.
You can just come up with your own interpretation ofwhat all this means, make some useful art, and go outand teach and give it.
Now.
Or wait until we come to148CHAPTER 8.
MAGIC TALES AND MAGIC LOREyou, because we will eventually!Trash Wizard Interaction withCapitalist EconomicsFinally, we all have to live somehow, and most of uscan’t just sink beneath the waves and escape capitalism overnight.
We need money to pay rent to live in acity where our loved ones are, to pay for medicine, getaround on capitalist transit etc.
How do we do this ethically without just selling out?Here are some proposed rules for Trash Wizard capitalist interactions:1.
Try not to buy raw materials and other peopleslabor; salvage trash and rely on mutual aid for free,and build your own stuff2.
To make money, selling labor is best, then sellingstuff made from trash, always try to avoid laborand materials arbitrage: don’t buy stuff then sell itdon’t pay people then resell their labor.
3.
Do not sell misery, try to only work on things thatare fun, while they stay fun, each product or serviceshould be an ADVENTURE.
We create.
As long as our fed debt money comes fromour labor and trash, we will always have a net gain of149capitalist currency into our system, making the directionof change right to allow us to survive best in the currentsystem.

And that is just the beginning.
Cars are central tothe industrial system which has crushed our humanity.
Ahuge amount of our oil based economy is used by the carsystem, adding to climate change massively, as well asbad urban air which kills millions worldwide.
Cars create a society in which anyone who cannot drive is disenfranchised, punishing anyone without perfect health andsignificant funds as well as the willingness to actively destroy the world and possibly kill living things just to getthrough their day.
Cars have filled up the USA withenough pavement to provide solar power to the entirenation(no small feat given our absurd energy consumption now).
Runoff of oil and other toxic chemicals leaksfrom cars into every water system in the world, poisoningevery possible ecosystem.
The companies that produce cars are some of the mostevil on the planet.
Several of the major global brands,including all the German ones, have actively participatedin genocide, an act for which they have never been properly brought to justice.
The endless stream of mineralsrequired to feed the input end of the planned obsolescence conveyor belt also destroys the world in the waysthat mining always does, with its usual disproportionalimpact on indigenous people around the world and onmany other marginalized populations.
154 CHAPTER 9.
THE GREAT JUNK CAR FEEDIn the U.
S.
and many other countries, car companiesactively work to undermine democracy and civil society,campaigning to make sure society is built around theprofits of their companies rather than basic principles offree movement of people.
The ability to move from oneplace to another within a city for free should be a basicpart of any social contract that people would actuallyconsent to.
Car companies have built a society wherethere is no universal social contract in regards to mobility: all mobility is held hostage, under threat of violence,by a group of psychopaths(all car makers) who force alltransport to make them money.
Even “public” transit isalways based on giant machines made by the same monsters, and is deliberately priced high enough to make surethe poor pay at least as much per mile for getting aroundas those who have the money to buy into the car system.
Every time there is an economic downturn, the corporate backed local government will use that as an excuseto further crush the lives of the poor, raising fares andcutting services at the very time those without resourcesare likely to be the most desperate.
Again, this shows thefact that there simply is no social contract in the modernindustrial city which all citizens consented to.
There isonly the raw law of force: whoever has the most controlof the industrial machines has the power of life and deathover everyone else.
Of course the rulers dress this up innice language about the “rule of law”, but there simplyis no such thing.
It’s a costume raw force wears in our155world.
So the car companies and their collaborators in government are enemies, and cars form an almost living enemy of humanity world wide.
What should we do aboutthis? The Trash Magic answer is always the same: firstfind the trash stream(which always exists under capitalism since destruction is inherent in their ways) and thenfind ways to organically incorporate this into somethinggood rather than bad.
Magical Answers!And what treasure there is in cars! Name any preciousmetal or special type of polymer or gas fitting or mechanical device and you can find them in a car.
A singleautomobile also has numerous computers of all kinds,which can be stripped and used for integration in ourelectronic systems.
And given the spectacular waste ofthe current system, cars really are free: while there is aused market for junk cars, it’s clear that for society as awhole the global stream of junk cars, like other industrialwaste streams, is a net liability not asset.
This negativevalue creates a global and ongoing opportunity for us toget the parts we need from it.
Another advantage of using car parts for industry isthe way in which the car is standardized.
There existmillions of units all over the world of certain popular carand truck models, and it can be possible to very accu156 CHAPTER 9.
THE GREAT JUNK CAR FEEDrately duplicate a complex design which uses parts froma certain make and model because of this.
In particular, the parts of cars are great for buildingrobots.
As discussed earlier in this work, robots in theright hands can have a fantastic positive impact on thehuman condition.
And this is really what this story isabout: the robots built from cars which destroy cars.
Ifthey are easy to build, and it’s easy to teach people tobuild them, they can self reproduce, creating an exponential destruction vector through all cars globally.
Robots must be designed and built and grown whichfirst find cars, then rip them apart for scrap, then sort andcatalog the parts, then reform them into more robots.
These can all be different kinds of robots, possibly usedseparately, possibly together, made by many people withmany methods.
The point is they should be easy, andcreate positive value(unlike what the capitalists build,ever.
)End Game: End All CarsDestroy every single car.
Rip out the individual atoms.
Rip them apart.
Smash the engines, destroy any vestigeto show that they ever existed.
Rip up the roads.
Buildstructures to live and work and grow crops in.
Makethem all green, smash them but don’t replace them withprivate property, this is a wedge to build more non privateproperty space.
157The end game is this: when the thing a car turns intoafter it ceases to be a car has greater value than evena functioning car, cars will start being consumed by ourtechnical ecosystem even before the end of their capitalistlives.
As noncapitalist ways of living expand, the companies that make cars will be increasingly starved of theconsumers they need to keep building and growing theirdeath machines.
Eventually the companies will die andthe existing cars will be destroyed faster than they canbe made, eventually making the capitalist industrial system simply physically unable to keep making any cars.
Without enough car consumption to fund the corporategovernment, there will no longer be military force protecting roads and they can also all be ripped up for useby humans and other living things.
Free Lives Don’t Need CarsAt this point, the capitalist will whine: “but withoutroads and cars how will I get around?” First of all, youhave to ask why you need to drive around all day in thecurrent system.
Do you really need all that? Do youneed to go to an office miles away to do things no oneneeds done?No.
No you don’t, and that’s how all your errands are.
Errands are unpaid labor you have to do for industrialcivilization.
Stop doing errands.
Stop working.

1: Ninth ContemplationChapter 10Factories Everywhereand NowhereSlipping Between the CracksWhere can we build? Where can we work and play andlive? Between the cracks.
Between the cracks of theindustrial system, between the cracks of empire, betweenthe cracks of cement and steel.
Just as we seek to buildfrom the discarded materials and energy of the old world,we seek to thrive and grow in the spaces they have castaside.
As with materials, those spaces are incredibly rich inevery possible way, when looked at outside the value system of capitalism.
Often these spaces are considered offlimits by the powers that be, and are supposedly private161162CHAPTER 10.
FACTORIES EVERYWHERE ANDNOWHEREproperty.
However the spaces I’m thinking of are notmonitored and indeed must be ignored for the system towork.
The foul waste filled waterways of suburban New Jersey are one example.
Often spaces under freeway bridgesare ignored and abandoned yet centrally located in acity.
Abandoned factories are a fantastic place to restart industry in the places abandoned and destroyed byorganized capital.
The dark, unkempt corners of various parks have places where someone can vanish fromsight and be centrally located with access to people andinfrastructure.
In general, our first choice for location will be somewhere that has naturally flowing water.
This could beeither a flow of fresh water or a tidal flow, but it is important both for a source of unlimited energy and for asource of materials.
Deep water is useful for being ableto move very large freight such as salvaged trucks or airplanes found underwater into position to work on in theproduction zone.
Water also serves as a source of coolness for protection against hot climates.
Evaporation can be used foradded cooling power using water driven pumps.
plumbing which can be taken apart, moved, and put back together should purify and move the water around, making hot bath water and god drinking water, as well asbuilding the input for the biological and chemical reactors which will process human waste.
163After water and energy, concealment is probably thenext priority for the “between the cracks” model.
Theeasiest way to do this is to be very low key and work onexisting land.
If you can camp somewhere, and the TrashMagic industrial production is quiet and small enough,perhaps you can simply do it unnoticed wherever youhappen to be.
Setting up in the factories the industrialsystem has abandoned en masse in places like the industrial Midwest of the USA is another great concealmentstrategy.
Camouflage in design is also an important tool.
Weshould be prepared to build infrastructure that does notlook like infrastructure.
One of the ways in which thesymbology of Trash Magic can be used is in an extension of Hobo symbology which allows for cryptic marksto indicate what infrastructure exists where.
Part of theart we study is building working technology which lookslike the environment because it simply is the environment: boulders, logs, sticks, rocks, patches of seaweed,etc.
Substantial infrastructure for industrial productionof all kinds can be designed, built, and deployed in thismanner where only the initiates in our Magic will evenknow it’s there.
164CHAPTER 10.
FACTORIES EVERYWHERE ANDNOWHEREBring the Means of Production to theActionMost communists and anarchists direct us to turn thefactory into a place of political action.
I propose to do theopposite: to bring the means of production to the action.
Where there are protests or occupations or refugee campsor war or poverty, Trash Magic can shine a light in thedarkness.
One of the great tragedies of every radical communeproject is when the forces of Law and Order inevitablycome in and destroy everything.
In the case of Occupy,there were libraries, various other services, first aid tents,all sorts of art and carefully built spaces, which wereall deliberately destroyed by the New York Police Department in their repression.
I see this as very avoidable.
Rather than building static infrastructure whichmirrors capitalist infrastructure, I propose that infrastructure built during various occupations and insurrections should always be dynamic and mobile.
And all ofit should be art of the kind which can be easily gifted toothers, to spread what has been made.
Production in Autonomous zonesOne of our goals is to erase arbitrary lines between thingsthat are currently separated.
Just as some people havetried to erase lines between protest, occupation and party.
165I want to erase lines between industry and art, betweenprotests and factories and workshops and squats.
Anywhere there are people and materials there can be industry.
It’s worth mentioning that I don’t mean just craftsor hobbies or art in the current definitions.
Part of whatseparates industry from those activities today is how theyall scale.
Art gets its value partly from a deliberate nonscalability.
Crafts are almost deliberately set up to benon scalable as well, to create some kind of perverse joyin doing things slowly and with a lot of specialized skills.
One speaks of a “craftsperson” as someone who has mastered some difficult special skill, and who therefore hasspecial privileges associated with that skill.
In Marx’s day there was such a thing as an industrial worker, and maybe in some places there still is.
Theindustrial worker is part of a larger whole which useseconomies of scale to change how people, energy andmaterials move in such a way that it will always beatout other forms of production on efficiency and “price”.
This has led to a historical dead end as the capitalistshave carved up the global working class so effectively.
And good riddance! Do we really all want to work insome giant factory doing identical boring tasks for manyhours, even if the IWW “owns” the factory and we allhave free food and health care? No to that future! Weshould bring the factory to the streets where the partyis, inject art and culture in it, and make it able to thrive166CHAPTER 10.
FACTORIES EVERYWHERE ANDNOWHEREand grow fast in the current world.
Here’s how it happens.
Anywhere there are people,energy and materials, we just start building industriallyand creating art as part of that process.
We build processes and document them(this used to be called culture)which can be spread and expanded quickly, which allowany group of people with minimal skills to rapidly buildan effectively infinite inventory of useful industrial products such as air conditioners, water purifiers, massagers,grinding tools, communications infrastructure, blenders,coffee machines, electric wheelchairs, soaring surveillancedrones, and medicine.
All these goods are immediatelyentered into the global decentralized database of free artifacts, which allows them to be immediately taken bycourier by hand to users who absorb it instantly into society.
This totally changes the balance of power in any occupation.
If instead of occupying the center of town andputting ourselves in conflict with current society we imagine a bunch of yuppies having to go down into a SacrificeZone to get some awesome artifact they can’t get anywhere else, which they also can’t pay fed debt for.
Thereis no transfer of fed debt or “ownership”, so all the normalregulations that apply to commerce do not apply.
We slipbetween the cracks to build up the factory, make stuff,absorb trash, improve the environment by putting in infrastructure easter eggs, and disappear.
Often the peoplewho come together to do this will simply not exist as a167coherent organization before or after the industrial/artevent.
The powers that be know how to protect “property”and to keep the have nots from getting it from the haves.
Much of this has to do with regulating money.
Whatthey do not have experience with is free people givingaway free stuff from trash and ambient energy in on andaround their system.
They’re prepared for a broken shopwindow, but not a free beer fountain in the park.
They’reprepared for a black bloc in the middle of the town squarebut not a boat factory in the middle of a pollutedtodeath river.
They are prepared for half a dozen commercial surveillance drones sent to spy on the cops.
They arenot prepared for 10,000 soaring drones built from trash,soaring over the dead land of the American West looking for pollution and mapping it for future use by ourindustry.
This set of tactics then informs the overall strategyand vice versa.
It tells you where to occupy and forhow long and with whom, at least to some extent.
Weneed ambient energy.
That means the sun, the wind, andmoving water.
Moving water is usually going to be thebest choice because the energy density can be so high.
With 1000 times the density of air, a relatively slow rivercan be much better than even pretty fast wind.
And waymore pleasant to work around.
Also waves and tides canbe used, as well as in some cases water that has beenpumped uphill over a long time before the establishment168CHAPTER 10.
FACTORIES EVERYWHERE ANDNOWHEREof a industrial occupation.
We reflect the industrial occupation of today throughthe looking glass: rather than not building stuff in afactory(strike, occupation) we build stuff in a notfactory.
So the first choice for a site is on flowing water, withtides and waves especially helpful.
Also note that naturalwater, even very polluted water, is also a source of manyuseful industrial feedstock materials.
At minimum youhave hydrogen and oxygen, but usually also a vast wealthof other chemicals.
So a very polluted wetland in themouth of a river is an ideal site.
With a combination ofskeletron and plastic we can build an amphibious set ofshelters and transports and food and water productionwhich add up to self sufficiency.
Then we need materials, raw materials with a clearpath to an industrially produced artifact or set of artifacts and raw materials to be moved by courier to anotherpost capitalist industry node.
We roll in, we build and distribute, set up infrastructure easter eggs, and move on.
While we’re there, wecreate a oneoff unique culture for that time and place,which propagates through the physical artifacts whichcarry data that includes the artistic culture of that uniquetime and place.
This also means that the phenomenonthat replaces the current protest model can be more longlasting.
Imagine if any of the famous protests or occupations, such as for instance the AIM occupation of Alcatraz had been run this way.
You could, today, use an169artifact with a piece of iron from a rebar salvaged fromAlcatraz and painted by one of the occupiers there.
Suchan artifact could then have been used for an electromagnet in a big motor that ground coffee beans in Zuccottipark during Occupy Wall Street, which was then incorporated into a sort of Jawa art car that roams the toxicwaste deserts of Arizona, collecting minerals for anotherfuture project, all with added stories and media and art.
How different this would be! We could all be participating in various insurrections, art communes, famousscience experiments, and huge parties at the same time,endlessly remixing artifacts that carry all that culturewith them.
Life in the DeltaThe future of humanity is in the river deltas.
just as thepast.
And it’s easy.
So many cities have out of the wayplaces an amphibious trash magic industrial culture canflourish without detection.
Freight transport powered bytidal energy driving electrochemical cells can be used asa universal industrial supply chain, with vast amountsof trash gathered for free from underwater salvage andswamp and wetland salvage.
Distribution of goods intothe capitalist economy in the heart of a city via waterfront parks can then easily happen, also under the radar.
By under the radar, I literally mean under the actualradar, with boats of such a low profile that they are not170CHAPTER 10.
FACTORIES EVERYWHERE ANDNOWHEREdistinguishable from wave action by radar.
Fabricationwill be right on the edge of water and air, with objectsable to be moved in and out, water to be sprayed andpumped and mixed.
The capitalists have had nanotechnology all wrong.
They have been looking for a clean technology with perfect control.
That’s wrong.
You want only fractal control, and very dirty, to in fact eliminate the concept ofdirty.
“Dirty” is a capitalist delusion.
We must lookbeyond it.
Under water, fire is also less of a hazard.
Hydrogen and oxygen gas plumbing should be everywhere,as well as compressed air, fresh water, DC power, andvarious materials which can be sent in tubes via plasticcells that get pushed along and tracked.
Just the abilityto make QR codes in plastic combined with floating plastic and pumps can make a amazing network demo.
Alsofor data transmission, when you have material transmission like this, it’s always trivial to send data by puttinga piece of physical memory onto a boat that runs alongthe channel just like in the pure information based networks of today.
Thus one of the many lines we seek toerase that arbitrarily divide the world is the line betweendata and not data.
Data is another capitalist delusion.
Information is physical.
Also agriculture.
If it were in stormy seas or tidalshallow water with strong currents it should be muchhigher density.
With both the atomic feedstock of seawater and the energy content of the tides and waves,171infinite amounts of fresh water, minerals, nutrients, andlight(possibly from electric lights, to get 24/7 underwateragriculture), also things can be 3d with light generatedelectrically, water coming in from all sides, temperaturecontrol.
The density of crop cultivation should go up byway more than an order of magnitude, probably at least2 orders of magnitude.
Thus a few acres of swampy wetlands in a strong tide with a good river current couldsustain hundreds of people comfortably if the infrastructure is built right.
And since it’s all mobile and modularand can be built from trash, even if we all have to moveor the State takes the stuff, infinite infinite.
In addition to deep ocean and river delta areas, thisprocess can build up land out of the ocean where it isshallow as it often is in the tropics.
Trash can be builtup into reefs of industry, designed to draw energy out ofand thrive in storms.
This can change the face of theglobe.
Guerrilla Fairy ArtOr maybe Applied Guerrilla Geometry.
Or viral physicalgeometry or something like that.
That’s where this allstarts.
In order to build a production and value systemart must be produced which has elements of magic andtechnology and pure art and also spreads by itself by being amusing or interesting and totally free to copy.
Itwill seem as if faeries are literally out in the wild build172CHAPTER 10.

Even if you areconstantly actively producing magical things yourself(theguerrilla aspect) the works of others will still seem likeit’s been done by fairies in the sense that it will feel totally alien.
This is how it all starts! Watch for freelygrowing magical geometry to appear near you!173Figure 10.

Chapter 11Visions of a BetterTomorrowCloudy VisionsWhen I close my eyes I can actually see the future Iam trying to describe in this work.
Many people besetby such visions would try to turn that into fiction.
Iam and always have been terrible at fiction.
Howeverdue to the highly speculative nature of this work I’mdedicating this chapter to my very poorly written fiction.
One reason this book is all the way in the public domainwith no restrictions whatsoever is that other people canpublish their own editions with parts changed and addedover time.
It is my intent that should this book everattract significant readership this chapter be rewritten175176CHAPTER 11.

It can take decades ore centuries.
The story here will thus take many lifetimes of humans but still have a narrative story.
Which brings meto the next part of this story: you need to tell it.
I’m nota fiction writer.
I’m writing these random sketches fromvague images in my mind but one or more of you readers need to re write this into various fiction works, thencombine them into this document.

But we segregate ourbathrooms in a logical way, for good reason, I have SERIOUS business to attend to and head to the oppositeend of the toiletsphere, where people with serious latrinebusiness must all go.
I choose a particularly awesome looking stone throne,head into the chamber, close the door, and now have awell lit one person sealed stone room all to myself.
I siton the heated stone throne, kept at exactly 88 degreesF using temperature controlled oil flowing through holescarved into the living rock by various cyborgs built fromgenetically modified rock eating fungus and some constructor drones.
I now brandish my stick around in aneasily recognizable way, alerting the local music machineto play sounds that correlate with the booms and shredsabove, but with my own spin: stream and rain noises,with some German industrial noise music mixed in.
More brandishments of the stick call up a math paperI’ve been working on in the cloud on the poop paperunit, which I stare at for a while while nature takes itscourse.
Having dropped an epic deuce, I again brandishthe trash magic stick, summoning the turd courier drone,181which grabs the turd for further study and use.
I nowclean myself up with the paper which was a math treatisea minute ago, throw it into the toilet, and have it getdragged off by another drone to the compost chamberwhere it will be turned into food for fungi which willbe food for the hemp plants which will make the nextgeneration of toilet paper for future users(watered by thewater extracted from the urine).
Now I wash up in the sink, indicate to the chamberthat the cleaning robots can flush the space clean andremake it for the next user, and move on through theexit door which leads to the opposite side of the bermthat the toilet room is in.
I stroll out the door, whichcloses behind me and locks, ready for the next user fromthe other side.
From there a short path leads down to theScience Swamp.
Here I see a bunch of nerds in goggles,some with surgically added gills, wallowing around in themuck, hair covered in duck weed.
“Hail E Coli!” I greet them as I give the proper gesture of rubbing the gut and hopping around.
“Hail E Coli!” they shout back.
I tell them I just came down from the Lemmy Pod upin the severe end of the poophouse, just now, and pointto the one I came from.
Oh yeah, they say, we just sawyours roll in.

“Oh yeah.

”“What?” I ask“I don’t know yet, but I see something in the genomehere.
Something very metal.
Something that should helpwith The Project, which we’ve been working on here.
And my sensors are picking up some sweet metal here inthe turd which should work for building nanoelectronics.

This is perhaps the most transformative on the list, and the most important.
It is alsoa huge challenge and potentially dangerous.
Perhaps agood place to start is with medical metrology.
Thereneeds to be technology which is free in the ways describedin this work which can be used to measure the purity ofdrugs.
Many illegal drugs are as dangerous as they arelargely because they are mixed heavily with mysteriousrandom chemicals added by the capitalists to increasetheir profits which are often poisons.
We need to buildup the ability to measure the chemical content of streetdrugs fast and accurately and with verification anyonecan understand.
The other main points of early research effort shouldfocus on either the most ubiquitous or the most expensive life saving medications.
We must learn to use thetechniques of brewing and genetically modified microorganisms to make designer medicines, We need to build upthe post capitalist drug industry in a safe way by building the metrology into every step to insure purity andsafety.
The very early phases of Trash Magic need to focus onbuilding techniques and tools that are maximally generalwhich can be used for all drug development and production.
The only way to do this efficiently given how manylife saving drugs we now depend on is to recruit heav188 CHAPTER 12.
FREE EVERYTHINGily from inside the existing biotechnology establishment.
We need to find the disgruntled geniuses in that systemwho are sick of it and desperate for a way out.
Theyoften signed up for that industry to save lives and findout they’re part of a giant scam to rip off or kill the poorand bleed everyone else and it’s depressing and leads toa desire to leave as well as to change our broken society.
I do not anticipate that it will be hard to find talentedbiotech experts who want to join us once we’ve shownthat our movement can do good science.
In keeping with the philosophy of Trash Magic, wewant to integrate the more traditional “magical” views ofmedicine with the techniques of modern medicine.
Thatis, as with chemistry and physics, the goal is to take thevery valuable information contained in modern scienceand reorganize that information in more human wayslooking to other models that exist in our history(varioushealing traditions outside conventional Western medicine).
Finally I want to bring up another important technology to develop fast in this process: imaging.
We needFREE medical imaging.
I have thoughts on this, whichwill go in the second volume and probably the third volume of this work, but I put this here as an open problemfor the reader in this volume.
Free Transportation and shipping.
The ability tomove freely from one place to another is yet another basichuman right which should be guaranteed by a civilizedsociety but which is denied in our current system.
What189does free transportation look like? I think the lazy river isa great example of a potentially free transport system.
Alazy river is a popular attraction at water parks in whichan artificial river is created which flows in a loop, allowinghumans resting on inflatable tubes to drift around the fullloop over and over, getting in or out anywhere.
I would propose that one of the most human friendlyways we could move around is with a larger and morerobust system of lazy rivers.
We could make waterwayswhich are pumped using water power from the overall netcurrent.
Ideally the water could be floated on with a variety of inflatable personal watercraft which float aroundwith no owner, waiting to be used.
This could involvestaying dry or being partially immersed or totally immersed, and it should include craft which can carry substantial freight, also an essential use of transportation.
Obviously a giant lazy river with free boats is a massive challenge for the early stages of this movement.
Ipropose that a way to build useful infrastructure now isto focus on rivers, and building transport for goods thatgoes both ways with cables under the sea that can haulfreight upstream driven by the downstream flow.
Thiscould run indefinitely with simple repairs over time, andcould immediately be used by many people for both utilitarian and artistic purposes.
One could put free stuffin the feed, let it flow up and down the stream, and itcould be grabbed and used by someone anywhere alongthe line.
This would mimic the basic functionality of the190 CHAPTER 12.
FREE EVERYTHINGrotating sushi conveyor belt, where a stationary personcan see all possible types of sushi pass by and grab whatthey want.
Another type of transportation which I think shouldexist after capitalism is skylines.
This is difficult, butworth building.
As with the lazy river, they will alwaysgo in loops, allowing people to get on and off anywherefor free, ideally in either direction, but with ropes or cables going infinitely, powered by ambient energy such asflowing water or wind.
These should have built in measurement technology that allow users to see various safetyparameters in real time and fix the system as time passes.
Skylines can also be suspended from various types ofaerostat, both hydrogen and soaring types.
I also imagine very slow moving giant spider robotswhich freely roam the countryside, and which anyone canget on or off of at any time.
These might be many metershigh, and have a whole industrial ecosystem on board, including growing food, and a local culture which is spreadas the great lumbering spiderbot roams the world.
Finally, I must address the underlying issue of transportation in capitalist society: much of it is to do thingswe don’t really want to do, and we won’t have to do itanymore once capitalism falls apart.
We often travel toget things which should in be available locally but whichcapitalism make only available in certain central locations, and we mostly travel to do work we don’t want todo which no one really needs done.
We must end central191industrial control of goods and food and we must endthe wage system.
With these changes, and with a freetype of medicine anyone can get anywhere, we would onlytravel to see friends and family and to have adventures.
This changes the goals enough that it will inevitably leadto drastic and unanticipated changes in the structure oftransportation in a post capitalist society.
Free Food.
This is almost too obvious to go intomuch, as it’s where most anticapitalists start.
Foodneeds to be really free, though, using the stricter definitions of free from the second chapter of this volume,rather than just “no money” type of free.
This meansnot only should you not have to spend work or time ormoney or minerals to get food, food should simply existin your world, around, moving on its own using the typesof transport systems described above.
If you want a carrot, just keep an eye out and a carrot will drift by on askyline or a hydraulic channel or a spiderbot.
Since thetechnology of automated food is so extensively studied inother people’s work I will be brief on this topic here.
Free Water.
Water should be free! Truly free! Whyis this so hard for capitalists and their collaborators tounderstand? From our standpoint, this means dirty water that will kill you should be turned into clean wateryou can drink on its own, without any work, all the time,with such plentitude that it is essentially a part of thenatural process of the world we live in.
Capitalists already sort of do this with their system of reservoirs that192 CHAPTER 12.
FREE EVERYTHINGcollect rain water, which is essentially solarpurified water.
They then hoard this and charge money for it andcentrally control it, of course.
Constructing infrastructure which directly convertssmaller amounts of water forever in different ways is keyfor freeing ourselves from the Machine.
This should exist, floating freely, in the ocean.
Humanity must returnto the oceans, and we should bring fresh water with us.
Huge floating fresh water habitats should appear in theoceans.
Also, water purification should never be about justwater.
It should be about the things we can removefrom the water: heavy metals, salts, biological chemicals, microorganisms, etc.
All these should be constantlyobserved by people, who can then use them as needed.
Free Communication.
This is another place whereI have to distinguish between this project and the “maker”or “hacker” movements.
To a typical mainstream hacker,a “free” phone would be one with enough encryption toensure total freedom from government interference.
Thisis not a useful definition of free.
The world they are building is one in which you replace the government snoopswith corporate technocrats who build your “free” gadgets.
Nothing built by a corporate technocrat is everfree.
I would argue that free communication means youdon’t have to have any interaction with the technocraticpriesthood at all.
That means it is so simple to build,edit, artistically enhance, and use that it’s obvious, and193can be done by anyone anywhere any time.
What does this mean in terms of practical technology? For one thing, way more use of analog.
One ofthe ways the technocratic priesthood has built a stranglehold on our communications is by having so many layers of horribly complicated digital software infrastructurethat is needed to do anything.
End that.
I would say the starting point for our free communications network is free space optical point to point analog voice links.
This can be done with the magic sticksin the earliest phase of this project, leading to immediate deployment.
Could encryption be used in this system? Sure, yes.
But do you really need encryption ifyou’re using a system like this? You’re basically shininga flickering flashlight at someone.
Going optical(withoutlasers) is also important because it avoids conflict withthe government bodies that tightly control the frequencies normally used for communication.
To be specific about what this will look like, it’s theTrash Magic Stick with all the aspects that go along withthat.
That means you get it free as a gift normally, caneasily build more and gift them on, and it needs no gridenergy to function, anyone can use it, etc.
Using vibrations of air and water to modulate fire, analog voice signals should be made with light, and then photo diodesand amplifiers demodulate the signal from a telescopebuilt into the stick and play the amplified sound directlyout a speaker.
194 CHAPTER 12.
FREE EVERYTHINGFree space point to point optical can be(and is beingby capitalists) scaled up to the global level.
The capitalists have built so much dark fiber in their speculativebubbles that we should be able to augment the free spaceoptical with free optical links in tunnels after things startto fall apart on that side.
Also while the capitalist Internet still IS running, it should be possible to extend theirnetworks all over using optical repeater stations we canput in free in our betweenthecracks infrastructure.
Free Robots.
This topic is so important obviously itgot its own chapter but I’ll briefly add here the reminderthat a robot is not really free unless you can build it yourself modified for your needs.
That is, you can see a need,then build and program and use a robot to fill that need,for pretty much any arbitrary need within the scope ofwhat a kind of robot can do.
That is what makes it free.
It is very easy to fall into the trap of building robotsthat appear free but still need a technocratic priesthoodto function.
Avoiding that is probably the largest challenge of making truly free robots, as good people havealready been working on the other parts.
Free Energy.
Another obvious but important one.
I disagree with much of the “green” Left who believesin giant solar and wind projects, as they have a tendency to perpetuate the existing industrial systems, justwith lower carbon impact.
Unimpressive.
I believe trulyfree energy has to come directly from your environmentright where you are.
It’s personal.
And it should al195most never be just energy.
Flowing water can and doesfuel whole civilizations, and is not just a “energy resource” to be used(generally by those with money) anddumped(generally very polluted and on top of those without money), as is so often the case.
Moving water shouldbe our first choice in most cases for an energy source.
Ultimately I claim humanity needs to return to the seaand that the best long term source of energy is the wavesand tides there.
I would place wind as a distant secondplace for sources of constant energy for electricity andmechanical work after the various hydraulic choices.
There are two other kinds of energy worth discussinghere, though.
First is heating and cooling, which wespend a lot of energy on, and which are critical to bothour survival and comfort.
I believe that heat should besolar or geothermal and cooling should be from waterand/or cooling from the deep cool earth.
There are almost always major heat sinks and sources around us ifwe bother to look and are not bound by the limitationsof our private property religion.
Migration should alsoplay a role.
Why should the same number of people livein a far northern city in the summer as in the winter?The answers now all involve private property, wage labor, and national borders, all of which I believe shouldbe abolished, leading inevitably to more natural migrations.
The final type of energy is Storm Energy, whichis where a vast amount of energy is used to complete amechanical and or chemical and or electrical task in a196 CHAPTER 12.
FREE EVERYTHINGshort time during the duration of a storm.
This will takelifetimes to build and perfect but as the world gets morestormy and we move back to the oceans we will build it.
Free Clothes.
Enough of buying clothes made bywage slaves and sold by criminals! We need to start getting all our clothes not just from the trash of the dying society but we need to build more free technologyinto them.
If we’re building our own clothes from trash,that should include things like goggles that can see microscopic organisms, infrared, various data visualizationetc.
Also, illumination should be built in standard, asthis is an obvious safety issue at night, where the capitalist forces you to go buy a flashlight.
Free Art.
This is the seed! This is how it all starts.
We are, first and foremost, an anti capitalist artisticmovement, meaning we make art, give it away, and teachothers to make more art.
The elements of this are throughout this book so I will not dwell on them here.
Free Sex.
How do the capitalists put a cost on sex?For one thing, by holding all the various technology todetect and treat sexually transmitted infections hostagebehind their absurd paywalls.
A full battery of testscan cost many hundreds of dollars in the USA, seriouslyimpacting peoples freedom to control their own sexualhealth.
Also birth control and abortion and other formsof basic body autonomy are not free until they are freedfrom the “ownership” claimed by the capitalists.
This isaddressed in the medical sections of this work.
197Free Love.
What do capitalists do that most hurtsour love lives? It comes back to the same reason we don’tmigrate in response to drastic weather changes: privateproperty, wage labor, and centralized industrial production.
Without these, you would be free to go meet newpeople, and when you meet someone free to live nearbut not with them, making a much smoother transitionto different stages of a relationship.
After you are in arelationship, the freedom from wage slavery and its associated devaluing of nonwage labor creates a much betterenvironment for that relationship to thrive.
Free Books.
No more dead trees! And not hemppaper either.
We need books that are as physical as whatwe use now, but which can be made from plastic trashand thus are waterproof.
This technology already exists,we simply need to build a free version of the machine thatprints that way, and adapt it for use with really raw trash,and integrate it into the rest of our industrial ecosystem.
It is my intent for the physical versions of this book tobecome closer and closer to this ideal as new editionscome out, so this volume is a physical manifestation ofwherever that process is right now.
Free Sports.
Capitalism distorts sport.
The focuson numbers creates an obsession with making and following a score and rank system as much as possible.
Thewage system forces coaches to also be business owners,which seriously undermines their roles as coach.
Sportsneed to be free.
That means no scores, no leagues, no198 CHAPTER 12.
FREE EVERYTHINGtournaments, no wages, no money, no mining!Free Games.
Industrial manufacturing should be agame! And we should all be able to play that game forfree.
This is not just a manner of speech.
Augmentedand virtual reality are likely to play a large role in futureindustrial production and those are always a grey areabetween “game” and “work” and “art”.
I say we callit all art, seize it, and integrate it with the rest of ourcreations.

Our technology must become like air.
Breathe it in!Chapter 13TechniquesIn this chapter I discuss the fundamental techniques thatI have used and plan to use in the near future in theactual practice of what I call Trash Magic.
This chapterwill change drastically in future revisions, and inevitablyolder editions of the book will look very dated as thispart changes.
It is tempting to work on this for yearsand to withhold publishing this manuscript until thesetechniques actually work well and can be used to make avariety of really nice things.
But since a large part of thepurpose of this manifesto is to provide my own guide formy work, I will plow ahead with some rather immaturetechnology here, and it will be saved for posterity andwill serve as a starting point.
I begin with sticks, because they’re fun and easy anddo a ton of things.
201202 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUESFinding the Right SticksDon’t hurt the trees! We want sticks that are no longerpart of a living tree but which have not yet been consumed by fungi and other organisms which turn logs intodirt.
Drift wood is also often too far consumed to beof use, although this really depends on the drift wood.
What we want are freshly fallen sticks from living trees,mostly.
And we’re looking for them to be between aninch and 2 inches in diameter, mostly straight, with nottoo large knots if possible.
A lot of electronics projects are perfect for sticks about1 inch around and 412 inches long, so gathering andpreparing these is a good idea.
Load bearing parts forlarger constructions should be more like 1.
5 to 2 inchesin diameter, or bigger in some cases.
Do not be surprised if finding nice sticks is harderthan you think it should be.
It can be surprisingly hard!If you live in a humid place with a lot of rain and waterand life, you’ll find that sticks get rotten very fast.
Sticksthat have been out in the weather for a long time in a dryclimate might be rotten while still attached to a tree in amore humid place.
I’ve spent a lot of time using pine aswell as maple at various times.
Pine is pretty soft whichis nice for getting started, it can get frustrating to spenda lot of time trying to cut a maple or oak stick by hand,especially if you’re just trying stuff.
One more thing to mention about pine is that aside203from being easy and fun to work and very common allover the world there is presently an epidemic in the American west of beetles killing large numbers of pine andspruce trees.
These trees, once dead, are simply a giantfire hazard that no one wants to deal with, making anunlimited supply of sticks for the Trash Magician to useshould they choose to go forage in that area.
Processing Sticks Into SkeletronAfter locating the sticks, you’ll want to saw the endsoff flat so that they’re not jagged.
I often find that it’seasiest to gather sticks by hand without carrying a sawwith you when you go out.
You can often rip the branchoff by leaning on it with your whole body, but be carefulyou don’t hit yourself in the face!I also find that for this stage it’s good to have twohand saws: one is a big rip saw with huge teeth thatvery quickly will cut through wood but is specificallynot intended for metal.
The other is a much smallerscrewdriverlike saw with a more hacksaw like blade foreasy carry and use on random materials including plasticand metal.
This tool is also useful for removing knotsand branches from your main stick branch.
Once you have your sticks of about the right size,you want to shave off all the bark.
This is done withany of various types of pocket knife, and I find it usefulto have a multitool of the kind that is also a pliers and204 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUESscrewdriver and such for this.
Ideally you’ll do this wherethe massive pile of bark and shavings will be useful forsomething, like grinding into sawdust which can be usedfor a compost reactor.
At the very least somewhere thereis already mulch will mean you don’t have to clean it upbecause it’s adding to the existing mulch.
Once your sticks are shaved and cut at the ends, youcut them to size, shave two flats, and then file the edgessmooth(simply for making it nice, this is not really functional).
I generally shave at least enough flat space tomake a nice point of contact when connecting them using the quarter inch bolts, so at least a half inch of flatspace is called for, maybe more depending on the application.
For simple electronics projects I’ll tend to shavethe stick down until the whole thing is about half an inchor maybe 3/8ths of an inch thick.
Finally, I generally drill a series of holes down the middle through the flat, spaced by at least an inch, sometimesmore like 3 inches or more if I don’t need many holes, orwith one strategically placed at the “base” for an electrical project as a strain relief for the power cord(mentionedsoon!) At this time I drill the holes using a power drilland a quarter inch bit, generally clamping the stick witha c clamp to my work bench, which I drill holes in all thetime.
My bench is a cheap door on a pair of sawhorses.
I also often use a small vice clamped to that bench forholding the stick while cutting holes.
Trying to cut holeswith a drill without some form of clamp is usually a bad205idea, is dangerous and is not recommended.
Finding the Right PlasticI have found that the best plastic for our purposes isLDPE and HDPE which stand for low density and highdensity polyethylene.
They are indicated by the recyclesymbols 4 or 2, and are mostly cross compatible.
The easiest source of HDPE for most of us is bottlecaps.
Standard plastic soda bottles which are made ofPET or similar plastics that I find more annoying to workby hand usually have caps made of a opaque materialwhich is typically some color like red or blue.
Anywhereplastic trash can be found, you can probably find thesecaps.
You don’t care how much they have been smashed,but you do care a bit how dirty they are.
You can alwaysgrind or cut off the really gnarly dirt with a knife or fileor similar sharp tool if there is too much crust on thecap.
It’s generally a good idea to have a small bin filledwith these caps near your work area.
Another great source of plastic, which I use for smallelectronics work especially, is the translucent(but nottransparent) plastic generally used for plastic milk bottles.
It is also used for various citrous juices such asorange and pineapple, so if you don’t drink milk that’sprobably a better bet.
Some 1 gallon water containersfrom generic brands of bottled water also come this way,and those can be found in plastic trash piles by various206 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUEScreeks sometimes.
I avoid milk bottles I find that waydue to what happens to milk when it’s been out a fewdays.
I drink milk at home and when the bottles are doneI try to immediately wash them out, rip them up, andput them in my plastic material bin.
One way you can get some containers like this if youdon’t normally buy them or drink milk is to have a partywhere the main drink is maitais or some similar fruitycocktail.
You can get orange and pineapple juice in thesecontainers, and mix them.
If you want maximal containers, get the smallest they sell, and invite a ton of peoplewho like to drink and you’ll have a few containers to workwith in a few hours.
Finally, another source for LDPE for very large scaleprojects like building boats is traffic barriers, the bigorange kind.
Don’t steal them, they’ll end up in thetrash eventually, take those and cut them up with ahacksaw(they’re too thick to cut with a regular knife,although maybe if you have a giant sword that will alsowork).
Plastic WeldingI’m sure there is a way to do this using really free tools,which I do plan to build.
However for now I’m using avery capitalist tool, the temperature controlled hot airrework tool which I also use for surface mount soldering.
It can be purchased for 50100 dollars online.
I believe207that a hair drier will also work, although the weld processwill be harder to get right due to a lack of continuoustemperature and flow control.
I set the temperature to130 C.
If you’re using a flame or hot air gun withouttemperature control it should be possible to measure thetemperature to target that or just figure it out by trialand error, which is how I ended up at 130 C in the firstplace.
The goal with working with HDPE and LDPE is toget it to transition from solid not to liquid(which you’duse to do injection molding, and that’s well documentedon youtube by others) but to glass, which lets you bend itand weld it but it still has structure.
When is it a glass?With the translucent stuff it’s easy to tell: it goes fromthe milky translucent color to fully transparent prettysuddenly as it hits the glass transition which is actuallyvery neat to watch! Obviously all this is hot, so don’ttouch it, and be aware that it stays hot after you stopheating it for a few seconds at least unless you hit it withwater or something to cool it down.
Just because plasticis below the glass transition doesn’t mean a 100 degreeC thing won’t burn you!As a first weld project I’d say take bottle caps, cutthem up, heat them until they’re kind of floppy, and areright next to the, moving the heat source back and forthbetween the two bottle cap shards, then when they’reclearly a bit gooey, touch them together, and they shouldstick, then heat the combination a bit more, maybe an208 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUESother 20 seconds.
Then when it’s clear that they’re bothgooey and are sticking a bit, get your pliers or tweezersand start smashing and squashing to get the two to plastic parts to mix.
This is the same basic welding techniquethat is used for various food technology like the calzone:the weld joint on the top and bottom bread in a calzonelooks just like the plastic weld joints you’ll make withbottle caps.
Salvage Components From BustedElectronicsThis section is going to be short because right now Istill buy a lot of electronics from the capitalist enemy.
As capitalist enemies go, however, Digikey.
com is awesome.
There are several companies that sell electroniccomponents online, with fairly similar prices and selection.
If you want to compare them, the site to use isoctopart.
com, a startup company out of Boulder, Colorado which compares all the prices and stocks of thedifferent companies.
That being said, I use digikey exclusively so that I can have a consistent bill of materialsfor everything, which uses digikey part numbers.
Digikeycan often deliver a part to you within one day in most ofthe USA.
As for salvage, the main electronics components I’vebeen salvaging so far are power supply related.
I have209found the the best way to get a power brick open is toswing it by its cord in a huge arc over your head andsmash it on concrete repeatedly.
It’s sort of like a particle accelerator, you want the largest possible swing withacceleration the whole way to get the maximum velocityof impact.
It’s best to do this on clean cement with abroom so you can easily sweep up the bits as it explodes.
The plastic case will explode but the components shouldbe largely unaffected by the smashing.
The good stuff inthere is likely to include transformers, capacitors, diodesand bridge rectifiers.
Other things in there will be usedmore in future versions of this work.
I will leave this section brief since it’s very much awork in progress.
I’d rather finish this book and then extend this later than delay the book while I do the researchrequired to have good specs in this section.
How to SolderThe best way to learn to solder by far is to find someonewho can solder and get them to teach you face to face,it’s a very physical learning process.
One thing all formsof soldering have in common which I want to mentionhere is the need to get the actual metal being solderedhot, not just the solder.
The biggest mistake beginnersmake is not being patient enough in heating the othermetals that are not the solder.
Also note that whatever210 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUESis the most massive metal piece will need the most heatapplied, be it by soldering iron or hot air gun.
When I use the hot air gun to solder, it’s always withsolder paste, and I set the temperature to 230 C.
Sticks for Hydraulic MachinesThis is another section that has to be a bit of a placeholder in this first version.
Sticks can be used to makevarious direct mechanical machines driven by water.
Water wheels made from simple arrangements of sticks shouldgenerate electricity to be used in that same apparatus, aswell as to move various belts and cables to move thingsaround in the world.
Water wheels should also be used asa replacement for many electric power tools, and a highresearch and development priority is building a powerdrill replacement that runs on water.
Sticks for FluidicsUltimately, the stick technology should have fluidics builtinto it.
This means channels, chambers, pumps, valves,and electrical/chemical interfaces.
I’ve done some verycrude experiments with this, but since nothing is reallycomplete this is a place holder for now.
211Chipping RocksWe must bring back stone! Not just for decoration butfor weight, for fluids work, for electronics, and for manyother applications.
Part of the Trash Magic skill set andtool set must be for simple stone work.
I have beenpounding rocks with other rocks and reading a bit aboutthis, but still have not fully developed the skills.
The one rock skill I have acquired over the years isthat if you grind a rock against pavement for long enoughyou can polish one side smooth enough to “skate” on,and can push that rock around under your shoe like askateboard.
This can be amusing, and led to all rockgrinding on pavement being banned at my middle school.
Measuring real time voltages and fluxeswith an ArduinoMeasuring voltages in real time should be easy.
And yetit’s often a huge pain to transition from doing this in aoverequipped over priced lab to doing it as a rogue element.
The trick is to use the Arduino’s analog to digitalconversion, with the new Arduino software’s very handyplotting feature.
I generally make a voltage divider witha pair of 10k resistors from 5V to the Arduino ground,with the midpoint connected to one side of the thing to bemeasured, and the other side connected to the ADC.
Thisis not useful if you’re measuring something connected to212 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUESthe Arduino ground! But if you want to measure something like induced electromotive force in an inductor it’sgreat, as long as you don’t go over voltage and blow itup.
More on this in future versions.
Measuring Electrical Transport of SlimeThis will be covered in very great detail in volumes II andIII, and I don’t expect this to make a ton of sense now,but basically my method involves putting small amountsof charge onto and off of a capacitor quickly and observing the voltage response.
Doing this fast can create anaudible signal that depends both qualitatively and quantitively on the impedance, and can also be used to observenonlinearities through various doublings etc.
Finding Creepy CrawliesThe real Trash Magic Sticks will have optical microscopybuilt in, along with the plumbing to move water withlittle creatures around to observe them.
For now, I havea very cheap plastic toy microscope that I carry aroundon my bike and try to find tiny bugs with.
I’ve seen someparamecia, some bacteria and the occasional tardigradeshooting by in the water.
Finding water rich in life inColorado is a bit tricky, but where it’s slow moving andcovered in bugs is generally a good bet.
213Design a new 3d ThingBlender! Blender!! Blender is a free open source software package used for 3d design, primarily for artists.
Iused to use commercial CAD software but that is notcompatible with the values of Trash Magic so I had toswitch to something free.
It turns out that while the professional CAD packages are better for professional CAD,that when we abandon the concept of professional engineering and take an artist’s approach that Blender is actually superior.
I will not digress with my own very poorintroduction to Blender as I’m still learning the basicsmyself.
It is, however, going to take a larger and largerrole in the manufacturing and design in Trash Magic asmore virtual reality and augmented reality systems getdeployed in the future.
How I Wrote ThisMy creative process is to think on things for a long time,then write fast as a synthesis of that thought.
The thinking process combines long library visits, long walks, longbike rides, Brazilian Jiujitsu and extensive use of edibleTHC products purchased in Colorado.
Actual writing generally takes place in a coffee shop,on the couch at home or in the library, usually in quickbursts of under 2 hours of work.
I did the writing ona MacBook Air purchased around 2012.
Most of the214 CHAPTER 13.
TECHNIQUESwriting took place in the Markdown editor known asMou.
I used GitHub Desktop to manage the versions andbackups on Github, which I used for my cloud backupas I went.
Each chapter is its own Markdown file.
Ashell script uses Pandoc to convert all markdown files totex files.
A file I call main.
tex then imports all thosetex files as chapters and provides the format using theLaTeX package “memoir” to generate the actual bookpdf(main.
pdf).
Illustrations were generated by drawing things in pencil, inking in the stronger lines, taking a photograph witha small cheap Sony digital camera, importing the bitmapinto the free art software InkScape, and then tracing intovector graphics.
The vector graphics are then resized tofit in a four inch width, saved as .
svg files, and then exported as 100 dpi png files which are used for the actualfigures in the document.
How to Color Your Wood StuffWood things should often be at least partly colored, notjust for art, but to code different parts differently sothey’re easy to follow.
I generally try to have electrical nodes connected to positive supply voltage be surrounded by red, and the minus supply surrounded byblack or green.
I also tend to use yellow for signal andblue for higher current lines that are not power supply.
215I have a set of colored pencils in my work area, whichwork great on raw, carved wood, but badly on plastic.
Ialso have a set of acrylic paints, the smallest and cheapestI could find, which goes on just about anything.
I believe most of what we make should be coloredand that the colors should always serve both artistic andpractical purposes.
Rope WorkI will not elaborate on this too much in the first edition,but I will just mention some rope techniques that are ofuse:• coachwhipping• Turk’s head• clove hitch• bowline• bowline in a bight• dragon bowline• carrick bend• figure eight knot• double figure eight knot• monkey fist216 CHAPTER 13.

Chapter 14Let’s Build This!This book is about actually building things.
This chapteris intended to start that process.
Since this is the verybeginning of a rapidly evolving system, this chapter willdrastically change in future versions, and it will be theleast accessible of the chapters.
If you do not alreadyhave a technical background a lot of this chapter maymake not much sense.
I hope it gives you some pictureof what this will look like at least in flavor even if not allthe technical work makes sense yet.
The idea is for all these technologies to reproduce andevolve and teach their ways to new users as they spreadthrough the world.
So eventually they will come to youand you will be able to make them!If on the other hand you are a person who has workedwith electronics quite a bit and likes building that sort of217218 CHAPTER 14.
LET’S BUILD THIS!thing I hope there is enough detail here to actually copythis stuff.
Do it! Make them, change them, give themaway, and teach others to do the same!Resonance Magic StickThis machine is to make anything with a spring or springlike thing or pendulum vibrate.
Vibration is generallypart of the physical phenomenon known as resonance,which I will discuss much more in the next volume.
Fornow suffice it to say anything you think of as a wave orvibration is probably an example of some kind of resonance.
The way to drive pretty much any resonance is thesame: push only when your push is in the same directionas the natural motion from the vibration.
We do thiswith magnets, which both serve to create something todrive against with the drive coils and also indicate motiondirection to the circuit which does the driving.
When electrical current goes through a wire in a magnetic field, there is a force on that wire.
The wire alsocreates a magnetic field, and we can think of this systemas an electromagnet(which we turn on and off fast) anda permanent magnet(which is always on) either beingpulled together or pushed apart(either will work).
Detecting the motion of the magnet is done using induction: moving magnetic fields generate voltage in a coilof wire, which we detect with an amplifier.
That ampli219fier is designed to be all or nothing: if there is even a tinyvoltage, it will go all the way to 5 volts(the power supplyvoltage used in elementary Trash Magic as well as USB),and at below that(including negative voltages) it’s stuckat zero.
What this means is that it essentially detectsthe direction of motion of the magnet.
Linking the output of that amplifier to a power switch(this role is playedby a type of transistor in the first version presented here)which controls current through the drive coil(the coil thatactually drives the magnet) causes force to be applied tothe magnet on only one side of the cycle of motion.
Perhaps this is all confusing.
It’s just an electrical wayof doing what you do when you push someone else on aswing: you see when they are going forward and pushthen.
Thats’ all we’re doing! But with a pair of electrical devices, one of which takes the place of your eyeswatching the moving swing(that’s the amplifier) and oneplaying the role of your hand pushing the swing(that’sthe transistor and drive circuit).
The drive coil is a coil of wire about 12 inches in diameter with 200500 turns of wire.
This is 30 AWG(AmericanWire Gauge) copper wire, and it’s a few dozen meters,which makes it a few ohms of resistance.
At 5 volts, thismeans it’s generally 0.
5 to 2 amps or so, that’s the target.
The sense coil is 50 turns of the same wire, wrappedaround the outside of the drive coil.
The amplifier is a circuit using the MCP6241 operational amplifier, a very low cost(less than a dollar), easy220 CHAPTER 14.
LET’S BUILD THIS!Figure 14.

(also a verygeneric name!) The voltage gain is 10,000, so 1 millivoltinput is enough to saturate the amplifier all the way to5 volts.
A core of ferromagnetic material such as steel ballbearings filled into JB weld steel epoxy can increase theinductance considerably, and also making it possible todrive steel or iron objects without permanent magnets.
The strobe light is a high power small LED flash221Figure 14.

The user can turna knob that is a potentiometer that controls the time delay, generally some number of ms or 10’s of ms or 100’s ofms.
This strobe is thus perfectly timed with whatever theresonant frequency is, and varying the time delay varieswhat phase of that wave we can see.
The combination of a wave drive and a strobe hasmany applications in both science and art.
A wave tankcan be made which projects water waves in a shallowclear dish onto a large screen(2 m across), and waves canbe generated using the vibrational drive and a small agitator of some kind(a wood stick or blunt wire will work).
This can be an interesting art piece that allows you to observe wave behavior with the strobe.
Is it art or science?Both.
Also the strobe can be used in microscopy withvibrating water, and the observed position of a floatingobject in the fluid can be controlled using the phase knob!This can be extended into a whole world of optical microscopy, as well as other phase controlled measurementsin a vibrating fluid.
A phase controlled standing wave illumination can beused to make living art by growing tiny plants in largearrays in such light, and controlling the phase to controlthe relative illumination across the green surface, makingwaves in the living plants.
Many different art pieces couldbe made like this, including growing bansai trees with224 CHAPTER 14.
LET’S BUILD THIS!this illumination over a many year period to make treeswith standing waves of vibrational motion and light.
Art can also be constructed by making the strobeilluminate various interesting steel objects which vibrate.
This can also be used for pure light art with more LEDson the steel.
Vibrational drive can also be an alternative to rotational drive for tools to work stone and wood.
A coil witha iron core can be used to pull on an iron nail on a spring,which then vibrates along the long axis of the nail, making a sort of small steel jackhammer.
Used under waterwith patience and some automation, this could be a toolto slowly and safely chip away at stone to make arbitraryshapes with minimal energy or time or effort input.
Thesame technology can of course be used for wood.
Vibrational oscillators can also have a variety of applications in massage and health, both for humans andother animals.
Vibration applied to various compost reactors and other types of chemical and biological reactorscan make a simple method for mixing or increasing reaction rates.
What effect does vibration have on microorganisms in loose soil? Is it ever good? We must studythis and find out.
Another simple vibrational machine that our drivercan drive is a pendulum with full swing.
This can be assimple as a stick with a hole in it and a metal rod as axlerunning through a plastic bottle stator, with magnets onthe ends of the stick.
The driver will periodically drive225the magnets with just the right frequency and phase using feedback as with the linear oscillator.
This leads toan accelerating rotational motor limited by the friction ofthe bearings, which has several applications.
One of themost useful is the high voltage generator, where the rotation causes a rubbing between two materials that built upvoltage, and then metal pickups transfer charge to a bigmetal ball and thousands of volts are built up which canbe used for various things such as plasma physics.
Thesetypes of rotational pendulums are also a nice demonstration of Josephson Junction physics and can be useful forbuilding models for that field of research.
Vibrational machines can also be used for simple propulsion of robots and for pumps of both fluids and gasses.
Itis also amusing to see how destructive resonance can beby putting magnets on glass things and smashing themwith the driver, which should be done very carefully if atall!Noise Magic StickThis stick allows us to both listen to and create noisemagic.
Noise magic has many forms, and we will workwith several.
First of all this will be designed to measurethe noise in tiny magnetic fields, amplify it, and makeaudio noise for the human ear.
This means you can literally hear magnetic fields, and by brandishing your magicstick you can control very sensitively what fields you’re226 CHAPTER 14.
LET’S BUILD THIS!listening to: changing direction with a tiny twist of thestick and location by waving it around your head.
Alsothis can be used to track AC lines with current for variousreasons, and can be used to trace underground signals,which can be planted using thumper sticks.
Two stages of high gain amplifier and one stage ofbuffer amplifier get from the detection coil to the speaker.
All amplifiers and the speaker are powered by a 5V sourcefrom any USB type supply and like the Resonant Stickthe input will be a USB cable.
The top of the stickis the speaker and the bottom is the pickup coil, withmany turns and a ferrous core.
Potentiometers are usedto tune so that all signals are centered in the middlebetween 0V and 5V.
This then goes through a isolatorto the last stage to let all AC through but not any DCinto the speaker.
Large, obviously labelled, wires connectto the feedback resistors in the gain stages, making iteasy to make summing or differentiating amps as well asoscillators.
Magnets can be used to couple vibration toelectricity to sound, for direct vibrational amplification.
Knobs and switches can thus choose gain, keep DC atzero, and make musical effects for art.
In the highest gain mode with a resistor at the inputthe stick can be used to measure thermal noise of the resistor.
This can be repeated for various fluids, making aJohnson noise detector of fluid impedance which shouldalso be sensitive to drift currents from whatever is goingon electrically in the fluid.
In addition to thermal noise227there will be shot noise observable from quantum tunneling through various native oxide layers.
This can beaccomplished with an old beer can found by the creek,immersed in a sports drink.
Direct interaction with theproperties of the oxide using acoustic feedback shouldthus be possible using quantum tunneling noise.
Properly wielded and modified, the Noise Magic Stickshould be our ears into a vast world of electrical impedance,voltage, current, and ion magic in general.
This is a precursor tool to the generic electrochemical probe that willbe made in Volume II of this work.
Again, with practice, it should be possible to do physical measurementson arbitrary materials using the Stick, both electric andmagnetic.
Another extremely important mode of operation forthe Noise Magic Stick is for optical pickup.
A very simpleand cheap optical sensor can be connected to the inputof the amplifier chain, converting an optical signal to anaudio signal.
This can be used to demodulate voice signals sent using fire and smoke and vibration in a farawaylocation.
Optics can be built into the stick to focus ona specific point, which might be a transmission fire faraway.
Another magician may thus transmit via one fireon a mountain top and be picked up and amplified as aloud acoustic signal by many other magicians miles awayin different locations! This can also be done with fluidsand at the microscopic scale with different optics to create an audio signal from a microscopic system, generally228 CHAPTER 14.
LET’S BUILD THIS!a biological one.
We can thus listen to the motion ofthe cilia on a moving protozoan for instance as an actual audio signal.
This is both art and science and alsotechnology.
Finally Noise Magic gives us another useful resource:truly random numbers.
Using physical noise like thermalor shot noise we can have a signal which is physicallyprovably random which can generate numbers using asimple analog to digital converter and microprocessor, atleast for now.
In the future, the better way to do thiswould be to have the random bits get directly encodedinto something physical in multiple copies which can thenbe used for a physical one time pad with no interactionwith any microprocessor ever.
We can thus have provably secure communication based on face to face contact,which can then be deployed over any distance using thetrivial one time pad encryption.
The attacks against theone time pad key generation generally involve compromising the hardware in ways that involve access to theindustrial process by which that hardware was made.
Wemake our own hardware as art built from trash and thendistribute it face to face, so these problems to not apply.
I don’t generally believe in the cypher punk world view,but neartheoreticallyperfect encryption can be usefuland it should be so easy with our system there is notreason not to do it.
229Guerrilla GeometryThis will be the subject of future work, but I’m just going to give a brief taste here in this first version.
Thethree dimensional geometry briefly described here whenI discussed the “tripod” and Skeletron can turn into awhole self reproducing art system which spreads globallyand which technology can be built on.
Sticks, rocks andtrash, who used with the right geometric ideas can beinfinitely strong if they pull humanity into a new worldof better life.
And that is the plan! Build viral information structures which go out and change the world in such a waythat humanity can live well in freedom from the clutchesof capitalism.

For this, go out in the worldwith your coloring book, find a piece of fantastic sourcematerial for the new world such as a rock, stick, bottle,or dog turd.
Stare at the thing, color in the ion emergingfrom the earth and contemplate the emergence of newelementals from the old as a new type of alchemy is born.
