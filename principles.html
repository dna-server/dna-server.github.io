<h1 id="pageName">Statement of Principles</h1>

<ul>
<li>
The purpose of technology is to create an environment in which all
human needs are provided for for free to all humans.  
</li><li>
A "technological complete set" is a collection of technologies which,
together, provide this.
</li><li>
Any technology which is not part of a technological complete set is 
incomplete, and the highest priority for any technologist working on 
that technology is to complete it.  
</li><li>
Technology should be built to minimize the number of humans and the 
amount of human labor required to complete a set, creating maximum 
personal freedom for each human to leave one set and join another.
</li><li>
A technological set cannot be considered to be complete unless it may be
 built from an existing stream of material, called the Trash Feed, which
 can be a combination of elements from the existing industrial 
system(waste) and from the natural world such as sunlight and rain.
</li><li>
The purpose of science is to create the strongest possible link between
the physical world and the human mind.
</li><li>
Until such time as the technology a science is based on is complete, all
 science should be focused on completing the set, building the tools 
needed to finish that project prior to moving on to obscure studies.
</li><li>
In order for a science and technology set to be complete it must include 
the full process for teaching others, from scratch, the process of 
reconstructing that set on their own.  A set which cannot reproduce 
itself using some form of education build into the set is not complete. 
</li><li>
All professionalism is counter-productive to the goals of achieving a 
technological complete set.  Creating and guarding professions such as 
"physicist", "artist", or "manager" is in direct opposition to making 
technology that can work for free. We must therefore oppose 
professionalism in all forms until such time as our technology forms a 
complete set, smashing down boundaries as needed to get things done.  
Artists must build circuits, and engineers must write poems.
</li><li>
We believe it is strictly necessary for all members of a society to be
cared for in order for that society to claim that it is a good society.
When basic necessities like food and shelter are withheld from humans
for any reason, we see great suffering. We must ask ourselves how a
society as "advanced" as ours still has this problem.
</li><li>
We glamorize creating technology that satisfies human needs and
giving it away freely, with no bias in regards to the recipients'
ideology, politics, behavior, religion, or any other specific
characteristics. This is physical: it involves building actual things
in the physical world and no amount of meetings, writings, elections
or speeches can ever accomplish the needed tasks. This is a different
type of thing than any of the other things in our society.
</li><li>
The ideological poison that has made our world so violent in an age of 
what should be infinite plenty is a worship of numbers.  The belief that
 numbers can be used to quantify human value is based on the origins of 
our society in an extraction-based economy, and one based on human 
exploitation, and it involves a religious belief in the reality of 
numbers that is not upheld by obvious observations of Nature.   
</li><li>
A path out of this trap is to exchange the hierarchies of linear counting
with the practical, relational symmetries of geometry. This geometry must
reject the mysticism of Plato and Euclid, and judge the quality of ideas
on how well they help us build useful things and tell interesting stories.
</li>

<h1>
WHAT IS TRASH MAGIC?
</h1>
</div>


<div class="blue border">
<p>If we know how to make something useful and cool from free parts that are easy to get, we can make as many as we want, all for free.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>If those items somehow hold their own blueprints or copying instructions, then the items become "self-replicating", like DNA.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>They are built for free and given away for free. When a community of people publish all their free blueprints for building free stuff on a free website, then the entire library of blueprints is available anytime to anyone in that community or on that network.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
Here's how to make your own free website:
<br>- - - - -<br>Make a GitHub.com account (your username will be your website name), and upload your own blueprints to share with others. You can copy this website to use as a template by clicking the download buttons at the bottom.
<br>- - - - -<br>Upload to a GitHub repository with the same name as your username. Your site will live at (YOUR_USERNAME).github.io and index.html will always be your homepage.
<br>- - - - -<br>Show your friends so they can make their own. Add links to each others' websites.
</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Recycling and free-sharing have always been part of being human. But we are in a special period. For the first time in history, all the chemicals, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well (as well as the tools needed in order to work with them) are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>The biggest change of all, however, is digital networks. We now have a great density of intercommunication and material transport (plus overflowing waste streams and pollution as a result). But being online doesn't have to cost money. Three people with any sort of wifi circuit or LoRa chip can make their own network for free. So can three hundred, three thousand, or three million.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>Our new internet ought to be a digital archive of all the things that matter to us IN THE REAL WORLD. The new internet becomes like an augmented-reality-game-map, showing users all the places around town they can meet cool people or get free stuff. The free stuff has a label that links to its website on the library-map showing how it replicates itself for free. The new internet should simply be a digital library/map of the free community, having dedicated pages for all important physical things like rivers, dumpsters, and farms. The purpose of the library/map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Trading USB drives with each other is a kind of internet. Share memes. Design social circuits. Create physical social media. Instead of a post online, trying sharing a cool or useful thing with a real person irl. Even better if that thing contains its own instructions for making more of itself for free!</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>All of this can be done while still living with capitalism and obeying the law, making it a good option for everyone to participate in. Additionally, every time anyone adds a single blueprint to their personal library, it makes it easier for everyone else in the network to live for free. All of the items and places point back to the online pages where their blueprints are shared. This is the same network on which all the rest of our blueprints are shared, just like DNA in any cell contains the blueprints to recreate all the rest of your body.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>If anything has been built thrice for profit, then it's obviously possible to build for free. If somehow the people who had the necessary materials spoke with the people who were already experienced in assembling, growing, or producing it, they could find a way for free materials in their surrounding environment to be crafted into that free thing. If they can repeat this process consistently, they have designed a <i>social circuit</i>. It is the social circuits which connect us and make up our new free world, not just the online networks. We want everything to be free for everyone, everywhere, immediately. The free world will recycle the capitalist world the way that fungus recycles a log.</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>Don't assume it would be impossible to build things just because there's no money circulating. If the people who provided the materials and the people who built it catch the vision of Trash Magic, then it can be built for free consistently. Everyone in the Trash Magic network is incentivized to do and give what they can for free because they themselves are benefitting so much from others' free gifts to them.</p>
</div>

<div class="red border">
<p>Due to habits of pollution and consumerism, we live in a very unusual age. For the first time in history, all the elements, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere. The consequences of this have been horrific, but we must find a way to recycle all of this waste. We can make good use of basically everything that we usually just throw away. So much has already been thrown away that everything is already everywhere. The tools to work with these materials are also thrown away everywhere. We are free to be creative here. Almost all unwanted stuff could work very well if it was repurposed into something new. Experiments always take time, go easy on yourself!</p>
</div>

<div class="green border">
<p>The new internet should simply be a digital map of the local free community, having dedicated pages for every important physical thing like medicine, waste reuse streams, and food providers. The purpose of the map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY. All of this can be done while still living with capitalism. It is intended to be done as close to free as possible and the whole system scales at a negative marginal cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
<b>this means everytime anyone posts anything on the Trash Magic network, it increases the strength and density of the whole network, making it easier for everyone else to connect however they like to the network.</b>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blue border">
<p>
<b>
<i>
it gets easer for everyone anytime anyone shares ANY Trash Magic, because participation in the network to any degree strengthens the momentum of the whole network. soon an inevitable thermodynamic shift occurs, pouring energy into the Trash Magic network in a movement that will make the most agile blitz-scaling of the venture capitalists look hesitant and ponderous.
