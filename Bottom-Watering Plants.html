<br>
Instead of dumping liquid onto the top of the soil of your container plants, you allow the soil to soak it up into its roots from the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.

From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-irrigated_planter">Wikipedia - Sub-irrigated planter<a/>:
<br>
 A SIP is any method of watering plants where the water is introduced from the bottom, allowing the water to soak upwards to the plant through capillary action.
