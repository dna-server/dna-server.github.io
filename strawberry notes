-------

CELSIUS

nice and lush, but falling into cup and potentially wetting too much of roots

75 mL;;; 1111 ppm;;; 65 Fahr;;; 7.6 pH;;; 2600 microsiem/cm
switched for
75 mL;;; 630 ppm;;; 70 Fahr;;; 6.3 pH;;; 1260 microsiem/cm

-------

TRANSLUC GATORADE BOTTOM

all dried out, a new shoot stopped, trying to revive, cut two dried leaves

110 mL;;; 255 ppm;;; 65 Fahr;;; 7.5 pH;;; 520 microsiem/cm
switched for
110 mL;;; 630 ppm;;; 70 Fahr;;; 6 pH;;; 1240 microsiem/cm

treated roots for a gray mold with 1.5 hydrogen peroxide and rinsed taproots in same solution for rot

-------

VANILLA

very droopy, even both new shoots, but still moist; however all roots are darkened, no white

115 mL;;; 300 ppm;;; 66 Fahr;;; 7.5 pH;;; 660 microsiem/cm
switched for
100 mL;;; 630 ppm;;; 70 Fahr;;; 6 pH

treated roots for root rot with 3% hydrogen peroxide by dunking
tried to wash and unknot roots but ended up touching them a lot

-------

WATER BOTTLE INSERT

doing great except maybe bugs getting leaves, many tall strong shoots but trifoils are twisting instead of spreading out

25 mL;;; 920 ppm;;; 70 Fahr;;; 7.8 pH
switched for
30 mL;;; 630 ppm;;; 70 Fahr;;; 6.3 pH

CELSIUS

very bad! all roots browned. some gray mold. halfway up roots is rotted, wet; yellow water

75 mL;;; 882 ppm;;; 65 F;;; 8.4 pH;;;
switched for
75 mL;;; 580 ppm;;; 6.8 pH;;;

rinsed in 3% hydrogen peroxide; suspended higher above water to dry out roots; metals leeching into water and changing ph and ppm?

-------

GATORADE

think he's dead.

75 mL;;; 580 ppm;;; 7.5 pH

soaked tons in 3% peroxide, switched water

-------

VANILLA

90 mL;;; 560 ppm;;; 7.5 pH
dead

-------

SPLASH INSERT

still looks like bugs, needs new location. shoots still good. great. 3 flowers are budding. basically all the solution is gone, which is i think good because it still looks great. need to figure out what is making the trifoils twist, though.

gave 30mL more;;; 550 ppm;;; 6.7 pH

-------

KRATKY WIDE

falling into it, roots half wet. too much mold. actually giving new sprouts tho. yellow water

105 mL;;; 870 ppm;;; 8.4 pH;;;

decreased to 50 mL;;; 550 ppm;;; 6.5 pH;;;

-------

SOIL YOGURT
