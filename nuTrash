==========================================================================

If the items we use on a daily basis are made from free parts that are easy to get, we can make as many as we wanted, all for free.
If those items somehow hold their own blueprints or copying instructions, then the items become "self-replicating", like DNA.
They are built for free and given away for free. When a community of people publish all their free blueprints for free stuff on a free website, then the entire library of blueprints is available anytime to anyone.

Recycling and free-sharing have always been part of humanity. But we are in a special period. For the first time in history, all the chemicals, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well (as well as the tools needed to work with them) are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere.

The biggest change of all, however, is digital networks. But being online doesn't have to cost money. Three people can make their own network for free. So can three hundred, three thousand, or three million.

Our new internet ought to be a digital archive of all the things that matter to us IN THE REAL WORLD. The new internet becomes like an augmented-reality-game-map, showing users all the places around town they can meet cool people or get free stuff. The new internet should simply be a digital map of the free community, having dedicated pages for all important physical things like rivers, dumpsters, and little free libraries. The purpose of the map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY. All of this can be done while still living under capitalism and without the use of force, making it a good option for certain folk. Additionally, every time anyone adds a single blueprint to their personal library, it makes it easier for everyone else in the network to live for free. This is because all the items and people point back to the online websites which are connecting them together, just like DNA in blood contains the instructions to recreate the entire rest of your body.

If anything has been built thrice for profit, then it's obviously possible to build. Do you really think something is suddenly impossible to build just because there's no money circulating? If the people who provided the materials and the people who built it catch the vision of Trash Magic, then it can be built a trillion times for free. Everyone in the Trash Magic network is incentivized to do and give what they can for free because they themselves are benefitting so much from others' free gifts to them.

Due to rampant pollution and consumerism, we live in a special age. For the first time in history, all the elements, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well (as well as the tools needed to work with them) are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere.

The new internet should simply be a digital map of the local free community, having dedicated pages for every important physical thing like rivers, dumpsters, and little free libraries. The purpose of the map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY. All of this can be done while still living under capitalism. Trash Magic subverts the status quo without the use of force, making it a good option for certain folk. Additionally, every time anyone adds a single blueprint to their personal library, it makes it easier for everyone else in the whole network to live for free.







Anything you create will have a link to a webpage, and from there anyone can find every single blueprint for your website. When you build free stuff and give it away for free, the item, however small, contains the instructions to replicate the entire system, again like DNA. A TRULY FREE COMMUNITY will be SELF-REPLICATING.

Any person can make a free website for their digital library. They can include links to their friends' libraries. Now they have a network of free websites, where each website contains many instructions, tricks, or blueprints for living well WITHOUT PAYING MONEY.

Ending Capitalism is the goal. STOP SPENDING MONEY. Everything else will slowly transition on its own. This is a non-violent solution which we have already begun.

The old internet only costs money because the huge network called 'the internet' is gatekept by corporations. All of the computers from the old internet can simply unplug or disconnect from their old server and connect to a new, free one.


The so-called "Internet" ought to come alive and become physical. 



The entire earth, connected by soil (the source of life), should come together to form a truly free, emergent, cybernetic organism. The earth becomes a body and the new internet becomes a mind. Thus, the planet will become genuinely, not metaphorically, but literally, a single organism.

Corporations have to spend huge amounts of money in order to get big. It's an enourmous cost that they hope to make back in sales later. But our networks are different. The bigger our movement gets, the easier it is to get bigger! The more people that live for free while sharing the instructions, the more people are able to live for free. Our movement gains more and more momentum the bigger it gets! There are many other traditions besides capitalism. The question is not: "What is the one true way to replace capitalism?" The question instead, is: "Which movements will gain the most momentum the most quickly?"

Check out this herb garden!

:::

Shayla made it for free! She used secondhand materials to build it all.
Shayla was so excited when her herbs grew, so she wanted to share. She gave some plants to some friends, and some seeds, too.

But then, Shayla thought, 'What if my whole garden, including the grow lights, the plant pots, and the garden housing itself were all self-replicating, just like the plants themselves?' Why, for that to work, her Garden would need to contain DNA, just like any other plant! So she drew up this blueprint

:::

Now, whenever she gives her friends part of her harvest, which includes seeds in the plants, she also gives them the DNA blueprint for the whole garden, which is another kind of seed.

Shayla's friend, Enrique, thought this was really cool. He received some food with food seeds inside, plus the DNA blueprint seed for constructing the Garden housing. He used the DNA blueprint to build his own garden, but made some personal modifications. Then he passed along his food and the modified DNA blueprint to some new people.

:::

So not only can the whole Garden self-replicate, just like the plants inside, but the Garden can evolve over each generation, again just like the plants themselves.

Enrique gave some vegetables and their seeds and the DNA blueprint for his new garden to his friend, Diedre.

Diedre was SO excited to get her free gift of free food, free food seeds, and free DNA blueprints which give her instructions on building her own Garden for free.

DIEDRE CAUGHT THE VISION INSTANTLY.

DIEDRE IMMEDIATELY BUILT TWELVE HERB GARDENS FOR FREE USING SECONDHAND MATERIALS, MAKING SURE EACH GARDEN ALSO CONTAINED THEIR OWN DNA BLUEPRINT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELF-REPLICATION.

SHE WAS HANDING THEM OUT LIKE FREE SAMPLES AT THE COSTCO!!!

AND EVERYONE SHE GAVE THEM TO CAUGHT THE VISION AND MADE TWELVE MORE!

NOW THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED HERB GARDENS WHICH ARE DESCENDED JUST FROM DIEDRE'S EVOLUTIONARY BRANCH.

ALL BUILT AND DISTRIBUTED COMPLETELY FOR FREE!

ANYONE CAN SEIZE THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION! THE DNA IS THE MEME! REPLICATE THE MEME, COPY THE DNA, REPRODUCE THE BLUEPRINTS OF REPRODUCTION! THIS IS NOT JUST VIRAL DIGITAL CONTENT, BUT TRULY SELF-REPLICATING PHYSICAL MEDIA! EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF FREE INFRASTRUCTURE OUTSIDE THE CAGE OF CAPITALIST SYSTEMS!

Because it was all done for zero financial cost, we can keep this exponential growth going easily!

When Skyler was given a free, self-replicating tomato greenhouse (this is what Shayla's original herb garden had evolved into), they had a brilliant idea!

"Let's make free websites on the internet where we can all post and share each others' DNA Blueprints!" they thought. So they got online, made a very simple, easy to program, easy to read website. On this site, all the DNA Blueprints she could find were uploaded so that others could download the DNA Blueprints for free. It's free seeds galore, and the seeds grow for zero-cost into PRACTICAL REAL WORLD INFRASTRUCTURE!

The DNA Blueprints can be the instruction-seeds for building anything, not just an indoor herb garden.

CHALLENGE YOURSELF:
Can you build
- a self-replicating computer?
- a self-replicating tuba?
- a self-replicating MRI machine?
- a self-replicating house?
- a self-replicating skateboard?
- a self-replicating medicine?
- a self-replicating water-purification-tablet?
- a self-replicating hammock?

YES!
YES YOU CAN!!!
IT IS POSSIBLE!
AND IT REQUIRES NO NEW TECHNOLOGY, NO NEW IDEOLOGY, NO NEW POLITICAL PARTY.
IT REQUIRES NOTHING BUT TRASH-MATERIALS AND MAGIC-WILL:
THAT WHY IT'S CALLED TRASH MAGIC!!!

If anything has been built thrice for profit, then it's obviously possible to build. Do you really think something is suddenly impossible to build just because there's no money circulating? If the people who provided the materials and the people who built it catch the vision of Trash Magic, then it can be built a trillion times for free. Everyone in the Trash Magic network is incentivized to do and give what they can for free because they themselves are benefitting so much from others' free gifts to them.

WE ALREADY HAVE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE NEED TO MAKE THIS A REALITY!
FREE EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW!!!

Due to rampant pollution and consumerism, we live in a special age. For the first time in history, all the elements, technologies and materials that we need in order to live well (as well as the tools needed to work with them) are spread all over the globe. Almost anyone can get almost anything almost anywhere.

The so-called "Internet" ought to come alive and become physical. Our new internet ought to be a digital archive of all the things that matter to us IN THE REAL WORLD. The new internet becomes like an augmented-reality-game-map, showing Trash Magicians all the places around town they can meet cool people, find source materials, or receive free stuff.

The new internet should simply be a digital map of the local free community, having dedicated pages for every important physical thing like rivers, dumpsters, and little free libraries. The purpose of the map is to help people live good lives WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY. All of this can be done while still living under capitalism.

DO MAGIC AND EAT TRASH!!!

EAT TRASH AND BE FREE!!!

EJECT KAPITAL; BECOME TRASH!!!


====================

a global library of open-source designs,

A system in which everyday items are constructed from freely available components and accompanied by self-replicating blueprints would enable their production and distribution at minimal cost. By disseminating these designs through an open platform, a global repository of accessible, sustainable solutions could be established. This concept is rooted in humanity’s historical practices of recycling and resource-sharing, now augmented by the widespread availability of materials, tools, and digital technologies.

For both capitalist stakeholders and individuals marginalized within the current economic framework, this model presents significant advantages. It reduces waste, lowers production costs, and stimulates innovation without disrupting existing economic systems. A decentralized, community-driven digital network could serve as a comprehensive map of real-world resources—such as rivers, recycling centers, and public libraries—facilitating access to free goods and fostering collaborative opportunities. This approach does not oppose capitalism; rather, it complements it by promoting sustainability and resource efficiency within the established economic order.

In an age marked by environmental degradation and excessive consumption, such a network leverages global access to materials and tools, empowering communities to achieve sustainable prosperity. By decentralizing production and encouraging collaborative exchange, it creates a self-reinforcing cycle of value generation—free from coercion or conflict. Adopting this framework offers a pragmatic means to address urgent global challenges while unlocking new avenues for economic growth, innovation, and collective well-being.
